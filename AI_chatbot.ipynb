Recently, therapeutic cancer vaccines have shown promise by eliciting de novo T cell responses targeting tumor antigens, including tumor-associated antigens and tumor- speciﬁc antigens. The objective was to amplify and diversify the intrinsic repertoire of tumor-speciﬁc T cells. However, the complete realization of these capabilities remains an ongoing pursuit. Therefore, we provide an overview of the current landscape of cancer vaccines in this review. The range of antigen selection, antigen delivery systems development the strategic nuances underlying effective antigen presentation have pioneered cancer vaccine design. Furthermore, this review addresses the current status of clinical trials and discusses their strategies, focusing on tumor-speciﬁc immunogenicity and anti-tumor efﬁcacy assessment. However, current clinical attempts toward developing cancer vaccines have not yielded breakthrough clinical outcomes due to signiﬁcant challenges, including tumor immune microenvironment suppression, optimal candidate identiﬁcation, immune response evaluation, and vaccine manufacturing acceleration. Therefore, the ﬁeld is poised to overcome hurdles and improve patient outcomes in the future by acknowledging these clinical complexities and persistently striving to surmount inherent constraints.\\n\\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\\n\\n(2023) 8:450\\n\\n; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-023-01674-3\\n\\nINTRODUCTION Overcoming malignant tumors, which are the primary cause of mortality, is crucial to increase global life expectancy. A staggering estimate of 19.3 million novel cancer cases and an unfortunate toll of approximately 10 million cancer-related mortalities were witnessed in 2020, highlighting the urgency of this challenge.1 Conventional cancer therapies, interventions, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, are substantially toxic and exhibit restricted applicability, thereby underscoring the urgency for developing more efﬁcacious cancer treatment modalities.2 Current relevant studies suggest that cancer progressing is highly associated with “cancer immunoediting”. This dynamic interplay indicates that the immune system is able to eradicate nascent cancer cells by recognizing mutated oncogenic genes or foster an immunosuppressive microenvironment conducive to tumor pro- liferation.3 Therefore, the fate of cancer cells is determined by a delicate balance within the immune system.\\n\\nincluding surgical\\n\\nthe primary purpose of averting infectious diseases. Nevertheless, their capacity to enhance antigen-speciﬁc immune reactions has gained recognition as a promising therapeutic instrument for combating cancer.8 Although vaccines can incorporate predeﬁned or unknown antigens, this study focused on predeﬁned cancer vaccines, including shared antigens or personalized neoantigens. After immunization, the cancer antigen is absorbed by the antigen presentation cells (APCs), where tumor-related antigens are processed into major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I/II complexes. Subsequently, the activated APCs undergo migration into the draining lymph nodes, where MHC I/II complexes bind to T cells, causing their priming and activation. The activated T cells travel towards the tumor site, inﬁltrating the tumor tissue under favorable co-stimulatory conditions and guided by chemokine gradients. Once within the tumor microenvironment, these activated T cells can control tumor growth through direct tumor cell destruction and cytokine-mediated processes (Fig. 1).9\\n\\nRecently, immunotherapy has taken center stage in the ﬁght against cancer. Several novel immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), oncolytic viruses, and chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapies, have been licensed for clinical use.4–6 ICIs have become the most promising immunotherapy type since the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s ﬁrst approval of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 antibody in 2011. According to Haslam’s data, although 43% of patients with cancer meet the indications for ICIs use, only 12% beneﬁt from the treatment.7 Therefore, exploring novel approaches, including therapeutic cancer vaccines, to address this issue has gained increasing interest. Vaccines were originally conceived for\\n\\nimmunotherapeutic\\n\\nTherapeutic cancer vaccine development has experienced numerous advancements and drawbacks over the past century, beginning with William Coley’s early efforts to employ inactivated bacteria to kill tumor cells. The history and the key time point of therapeutic cancer vaccines could be found in Fig. 2. Despite the progress in this ﬁeld, further exploration is required to improve the accessibility and effectiveness of cancer-active immunothera- pies. This is particularly important considering these treatments’ restricting the number of high cost and limited availability, individuals who can beneﬁt from them. The ultimate objective of cancer vaccines is to prime antigen-speciﬁc T cells, which are indispensable for an effective immune response against cancer.10\\n\\n1Department of Oncology, East Hospital Afﬁliated to Tongji University, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China and 2Postgraduate Training Base, Shanghai East Hospital, Jinzhou Medical University, Shanghai 200120, China Correspondence: Wanlu Cao (Wanlu724576084@hotmail.com) or Chunyan Dong (cy_dong@tongji.edu.cn)\\n\\nReceived: 14 May 2023 Revised: 8 September 2023 Accepted: 19 September 2023\\n\\n© The Author(s) 2023\\n\\n2\\n\\nTherapeutic cancer vaccines: advancements, challenges, and prospects Fan et al.\\n\\nFig. 1 The mechanism of cancer vaccine in vivo. After the tumor antigens migrate into the body in different forms, they are phagocytosed, intracellularly expressed, and efﬁciently processed by specialized antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of dendritic cells presents antigens to their surface, and the MHC complexes activate antigen-speciﬁc T-cells by binding to T-cell receptors (TCR) on the surface of T-cells, therefore safely, persistently, and speciﬁcally destroying tumor cells and inhibiting tumor growth\\n\\nFig. 2 The history and the key time points of therapeutic cancer vaccines\\n\\nCurrent clinical studies on cancer vaccines are challenging and have not yielded remarkable clinical outcomes.11 However, innovative strategies and technological advancements present promising prospects to overcome these challenges and broaden the opportunities for clinical applications.\\n\\nIn this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current cancer vaccines. First, we describe strategies for antigen repertoire selection and delivery platforms to improve cancer vaccine design. We subsequently review ongoing clinical trials and explore future advancements in this ﬁeld by exploring key areas, such as neoantigens identiﬁcation and selection, innovative vaccine platform development, and strategies for enhancing the antigen-speciﬁc T cell response. Additionally, we summarize the most recent clinical advancements in cancer vaccine research and provide a future perspective on the challenges and opportunities in this promising novel immunotherapy.\\n\\nOPTIMAL TUMOR ANTIGEN SELECTION IN CANCER VACCINE Ideally, candidate tumor antigen for cancer vaccines have to exhibit elevated expression in tumor tissue. Tumor antigens are categorized into shared and personalized antigens based on their expression frequency.12 Shared antigens are “public” antigens\\n\\ncontaining hotspot mutations by a relatively common human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele in patients.13 They target tumor- associated antigens (TAA) and tumor-speciﬁc antigens (TSA). TAA is an autoantigen expressed in normal tissues and overexpressed in various cancers, tissue- differentiation neoantigens, and overexpression antigens.14–16 Contrarily, TSA is directly produced from numerous non- synonymous somatic mutations that can increase MHC presenta- tion to antigen epitopes or alter their T cell receptor (TCR) recognition. Melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) is normally expressed and overexpressed in the testis and melanoma, respectively, whereas human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical and oropharyngeal cancers have high expression of the E6 and E7 proteins of high-risk HPV.17,18 Therefore, the shared TAAs in patients with cancer make it a promising off-the-shelf immunotherapy option. Personalized cancer vaccines have recently gained the spotlight due to modern high-throughput gene sequencing technology development and a deeper under- standing of neoantigens production. These TSAs are generally not germ line-encoded and rarely cause immune tolerance, rendering them ideal as tumor immunotherapy targets.19 Immunogenic neoantigens selection must be performed using complementarity vaccine algorithms\\n\\nincluding cancer-testis antigens,\\n\\nconsidering several\\n\\nfactors. However,\\n\\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\\n\\n(2023) 8:450\\n\\nproduction time, vaccine design costs, and subsequent persona- lized neoantigen pool generation pose signiﬁcant challenges for the large-scale implementation of this technology.\\n\\nShared antigen cancer vaccine Shared antigen vaccines target antigens commonly expressed across multiple cancer types compared to personalized cancer vaccines targeting speciﬁc mutations in an individual’s tumor, making them off-the-shelf and low-cost immunotherapies.\\n\\nTumor-associated antigen. Shared antigen vaccines can be developed using these two approaches.11 One common strategy involves employing TAAs, which are proteins highly expressed by the ﬁrst approved cancer cells. An illustrative instance is autologous dendritic cell vaccine, sipuleucel-T, which prolonged survival of 2–4 months in patients with metastatic resistant prostate cancer. This therapeutic intervention targets prostate acid phosphatase, a TAA that exhibits high expression levels in prostate cancer cells.20,21 Additionally, a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine comprising four TAAs has demonstrated the capacity to elicit robust and durable immune responses directed against these antigens, with or without in patients with unresectable melanoma.22 A lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based cancer vaccine encoding the four most frequent Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS) mutation antigens (G12D, G12V, G13D, and G12C) is able to elicit both cytotoxic and memory T cell phenotypes targeting KRAS- mutated tumor cells. Currently, a phase 1 clinical trial is carried out cancers in (NCT03948763).23 Wilms’ is an immunogenic antigen which is overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia. Five elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia were treated with WT1 recombinant protein in a phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT01051063) and the majority of the patients achieved above- average response durations.24 MAGE family proteins are the most widely used immunogenic cancer-testis antigens with hetero- geneous expression in tumor cells and poor understanding.16,25 A large-scale MAGE-A3 immunotherapy-focused phase 3 trial as an adjuvant therapy was conducted, however, the vaccine didn’t improve the clinical beneﬁts of the patients with resected stage III melanoma, leading to its discontinuation.26 In a phase 3 trial, the MAGE-A3 protein vaccine was terminated because of its limited immunogenicity in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).27 Notably, it may be due to cross-reactivity with many MAGE-A isoforms. Therefore, a MAGE-A DNA vaccine consensus sequence was formulated to address this issue, which elicited a robust immune response, signiﬁcantly leading to a substantial reduction in tumor growth in mice.28 Mucin 1 glycoprotein is widely distributed and abnormally glycosylated on cancer cells’ surfaces. Tecemotide, a peptide vaccine used against mucin 1, extended the overall survival in patients with advanced NCSLC who were concurrently undergoing chemoradiother- apy.29,30 Additionally, high expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu (HER2/neu) makes some breast cancers highly malignant.31 The peptide vaccine Nelipepimut-S was safe in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer; however, no therapeu- tic effect was observed when compared to the placebo group.32 Nevertheless, the use of Nelipepimut-S plus trastuzumab resulted in speciﬁc and durable immune responses in patients with triple- negative breast cancer and resulted in a signiﬁcant clinical beneﬁt to the patients.33 A plasmid DNA vaccination encoding the HER2/ neu intracellular domain was shown in a recent phase 1 clinical study to induce the production of antigen-speciﬁc type 1 T cells in a majority of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.15\\n\\nICI,\\n\\npatients\\n\\nwith\\n\\nadvanced tumor 1 (WT1)\\n\\nKRAS-mutated\\n\\n(OS)\\n\\ntargeting shared Viral antigen.

Research has shown that an HPV16 RNA- lipid complex vaccine can induce the complete regression and establish durable T cell memory in rapidly progressing HPV- positive tumors.38 A therapeutic DNA vaccine, GX-188E, plus pembrolizumab, induced HPV E6 and E7 speciﬁc T cell immune responses and preliminary antitumor activity in patients with recurrent or advanced cervical cancer.39 Therefore, these studies indicate that viral antigens may be the optimal antigen targets option in virus-related cancers.\\n\\nPreclinical and clinical researches indicate the generalizability of shared tumor antigens to serve as viable targets for cancer vaccination, although they are limited by tumor heterogeneity, poor immunogenicity, and immune tolerance. Therefore, further efﬁcient approaches are under investigation to leverage the full range of tumor antigens.\\n\\nNeoantigen cancer vaccine TAAs’ low expression in normal tissue results in “central thymic tolerance” within antigen-speciﬁc T cells leading to an inadequate stimulation in anti-tumor T cell immune responses.40,41 However, neoantigens derived from non-synonymous cell variants, includ- ing point mutations, gene fusions, and RNA editing events, are only expressed in tumor cells.42–45 Neoantigens can bypass thymus-negative selection because of the high immunogenicity of somatic tumor mutation-acquired neoantigens, leading to a robust neoantigen-speciﬁc T cell response.46 Genomic and transcriptional proﬁling has made identifying putative neoanti- gens possible in cancers that have high immunogenicity, with in next-generation sequencing and bioinfor- advancements matics.13,47 To date, it is noteworthy that current researches suggest that only a minority of neoantigens have the capacity to induce neoantigen-speciﬁc T cell responses, making neoantigen prediction critical for clinical success.\\n\\nNeoantigen identiﬁcation. Neoantigens are categorized accord- ing to the somatic mutations type that cause non-synonymous protein changes (Fig. 3a).48 The most potential neoantigen sources in cancer can be found in Fig. 3b. The identiﬁcation of immunogenic neoantigens has signiﬁcantly beneﬁted from the development of in silico methods and tools that utilize high- throughput sequencing data.49 Recent investigations have con- ducted thorough characterizations of neoantigens that originate from single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (INDELs).49 Moreover, mutations stemming from gene fusions, copy number variations, transcriptional variants (such as selective splicing, promoter, and A-to-I editing), and microsatellite instability have been shown to give rise to neoantigens. Traditional complementary DNA library screening methods are conﬁned to the identiﬁcation of variant antigens in speciﬁc transcripts, especially GC-rich or low-expression transcripts. However, whole-exome sequencing (WES) and mass spectrometry (MS) have emerged as potent approaches for identifying HLA- bound peptides and forecasting distinctive cancer epitopes to facilitate personalized vaccine development.50–52 Distinct high- throughput sequencing data are required for the identiﬁcation of neoantigens originating from different sources. In the case of SNV- based sources, pTuneos can evaluate actual immunogenicity by considering natural processing and presentation, utilizing data from tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocyte-recognized neopeptides in a melanoma cancer vaccine cohort.53 Several integrated processing tools like pVAC-seq,54 TIminer55 and ProGeo-Neo56 can pinpoint\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\nTherapeutic cancer vaccines: advancements, challenges, and prospects Fan et al.\\n\\nFig. 3 Prediction of neoantigen candidates. a An overview of the bioinformatic characterization of neoantigens. b The somatic mutants originate from multiple sources, including single nucleotide variants, insertions/deletions, gene fusion, copy number variant, splice variant and microsatellite instability. c HLA typing from WES and RNA-seq could be found by the in-silico tools. d Peptide processing prediction with several algorithms. e Available bioinformatic pipelines for peptide-MHC binding prediction. f Available bioinformatic pipelines for T cell recognition.

These tools utilize input from WES/RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data and implement a series of ﬁltering steps guided by predeﬁned threshold values to eliminate potential false positives. In situations involving gene fusions, the automated INTEGRATE-Neo pipeline stands as the pioneering platform for gene fusion neoantigen discovery.57\\n\\nOnce candidate neoantigens are identiﬁed, it becomes crucial to verify their capability for effective MHC molecular presentation and recognition by TCRs. Consequently, substantial effort is still warranted to access the potential immunogenicity of neoantigen candidates. This aspect will be examined in detail in the subsequent section.\\n\\nHLA typing: The presentation of neoantigens necessitates specialized APCs with MHC I or II molecules. Given the extensive polymorphism of human HLA alleles—comprising over 24,000 distinct HLA gene complexes—accurate HLA typing is imperative to precisely predict neoantigens.58 Calculated HLA typing can be accomplished by analyzing patient peripheral blood samples through the NGS platform or sequence-speciﬁc PCR ampliﬁcation. Recently developed HLA typing algorithms, such as OptiType,59 Polysolver,60 HLAscan,61 and PHLAT62 are effective for the identifying HLA class I alleles, demonstrating a high degree of precision. While benchmarking studies for HLA class II algorithms alone are comparatively limited, those that have been conducted\\n\\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\\n\\n(2023) 8:450\\n\\nindicate that combined algorithms targeting both HLA class I and like seq2hla63 and HLA*PRG,64 exhibit high accuracy rates. II, Kourami, a graph-guided classical HLA gene assembly technique, empowers the construction of allelic sequences using high- coverage whole genome sequencing data.65 Successful neoanti- gen delivery is the initial stride in generating tumor-speciﬁc T cells, rendering the deletion or reduced expression of HLA gene loci a pivotal mechanism for evading immunotherapy.66 An instance involving a patient with a tumor and poly-neo-epitope-speciﬁc immunity, who received a personalized cancer vaccine, high- lighted the discovery of β2-microglobulin transcript deletions in HLA class I transcription analysis through NGS sequencing. This patient subsequently encountered resistance to the tumor vaccine and experienced disease recurrence.67 The reduction in the expression of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) has also been recognized as a factor that hinders the presentation of tumor antigens.68 Thus, discerning the HLA locus while concurrently elucidating the dynamics of related presenting genes empowers investigators to discover neoantigens binding to expressed and unmutated alleles.\\n\\nPeptide processing: To function as a natural T cell antigen, the original peptide must undergo a series of processing steps. These processes are essential to prepare the peptide for presentation on the MHC molecule. The natural processing and presentation of antigens constitute an intricate process, necessitating precise peptide processing to enable its effective presentation on the MHC molecule. Thus, even if a peptide is predicted to exhibit a strong binding afﬁnity to MHC, it may not trigger a T cell response due to upstream peptide processing factors. These factors encompass how the protein is cleaved, trimmed, loaded onto the MHC molecule, and transported to the cell surface, which prevents the actual loading of the peptide.69 Owing to constraints posed by the immune proteasome, not all k-mer peptides can be naturally generated in vivo, and only a fraction of these peptides can be translocated to the appropriate cellular compartments to interact with MHC molecules.70 As a result, several computational tools have been developed with a speciﬁc focus on immune proteasomal processing and peptide cleavage. A pivotal step preceding the peptide-MHC interaction is proteolysis, the break- down of proteins into peptides facilitated by the immune proteasome.71 Methods like ProteaSMM and NetChop 20 S were most effective in capturing in vitro proteasome digestion patterns for MHC class I antigens. Conversely, NetChop Cterm trained on MHC-I ligand data demonstrated superior predictive capabilities for in vivo whole-cell proteolysis.71 Moreover, TAP proteins play a role in translocating peptide fragments from the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby facilitating the process of loading these peptides onto MHC molecules. Tools targeting TAP protein afﬁnity, such as TAP-hunter, have been devised to predict peptide transportation efﬁciency.72 The endeavor to create an integrated process encompassing relevant metadata and acces- sing data on naturally processed peptides from an immunological perspective is pivotal to identify optimal target antigens and predict class I and II epitopes.73\\n\\nThe algorithms development Peptide-MHC binding prediction: speciﬁcally designed to accurately predict the binding of neoantigens to MHC class I and class II molecules is a crucial approach in forecasting the immunogenicity potential of neoanti- gens. Here, we present the main algorithmic innovations and the data classes used to train these algorithms. Established tools used for predicting MHC binding afﬁnity are trained using data derived from in vivo binding afﬁnity measurements or eluting ligands detected by MS.74 By directly studying ligands eluting from peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes, predictive models can encom- pass distinctive characteristics of peptides that have undergone the complete processing pathway. A systematic benchmarking of\\n\\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\\n\\n(2023) 8:450\\n\\nTherapeutic cancer vaccines: advancements, challenges, and prospects Fan et al.\\n\\npMHC class I combined with predictors revealed that NetMHCpan and MHCﬂurry exhibited the best area under the receiver curve.74–76 operating analysis demonstrated that MixMHCpred 2.0.1 excelled predicting peptide binding to the HLA-I isoforms by evaluating the probability of peptide sequence to be presented on the cell surface.77 While algorithms targeting the binding afﬁnity to MHC class II are less mature, a blend of matrix-based techniques and artiﬁcial net- works, exempliﬁed by DeepMHCII and NetMHCIIpan, facilitates the accurate recognition of CD4+ T cell epitopes.78,79 Moreover, the stability of pMHC complexes can effectively increase the likelihood of recognition by T cells and is a better correlate of immunogeni- city compared to MHC class I binding afﬁnity.80 Therefore, researchers developed a neural network-based peptide-MHC-I complex stability pan-speciﬁcity predictor (NetMHCstabpan), which, in combination with an MHC binding predictor, can signiﬁcantly improve the prediction of antigenic epitopes.81 To ascertain the thermal stability of cleavable peptide/HLA com- plexes, the NetMHC 4.0 approach can also be employed, facilitating the screening of mutant peptides with the utmost likelihood of cell surface expression.82\\n\\ncharacteristic\\n\\nBenchmarking\\n\\nrecognition: Precise prediction and identiﬁcation of T cell interactions between TCR and pMHC complexes constitute a substantial computational challenge within the realm of ther- apeutic cancer vaccines. A range of computational tools have emerged to analyze diverse TCR patterns and forecast peptide- TCR-speciﬁc interactions. GLIPH,83 DeepTCR84 and TCRmatch85 establish global similarities and shared speciﬁcities among TCR sequences. NetTCR has been formulated by constructing a peptide-speciﬁc approach.86 Early iterations of these tools could solely discern binding patterns of antigens based on numerous established TCR binding proﬁles, yet they fell short in recogniz- ing antigens that had never surfaced within the body or those only scant TCR binding proﬁles were available.87,88 In this context, TITAN has enabled the exploration of generalization capabilities for unencountered TCRs and/or epitopes, employing bimodal neural networks that explicitly encode TCR sequences and epitopes.89 Given the extensive diversity intrinsic to the TCR interaction landscape, there remains considerable room for reﬁning the learning of peptide-TCR binding prediction, espe- cially for peptides not represented within the training dataset or for exogenous peptides. PanPep is a general framework that identiﬁes TCR-antigen binding in 3D crystal structures, amalga- mating the principles of neural Turing machines and meta- learning.90\\n\\nFurthermore, there are still some assessments of immunogeni- city of neoantigen epitopes that need to be taken into account, including transcript expression, dissimilarity to self, similarity to epitopes associated with pathogens, mutation clonality and indispensability and loss of heterozygosity of essential gene product, which can facilitate the selection of neoantigen candidates that have the potential to generate T cell responses, contributing to the subsequent customization of personalized vaccines for individual patients.48,49 Accurately identifying and selecting biological knowledge-guided and computational algorithm-assisted immunogenic neoantigen candidates is the cornerstone of personalized tumor vaccines’ clinical success. Many groups have developed proprietary and unique algorithms for selecting immunogenic epitopes that could help drive the next generation of cancer immunotherapies and personalized cancer vaccines.90–93\\n\\nNeoantigen-based cancer vaccine. Neoantigen vaccines are pro- mising for stimulating cytotoxic T cells to mount effective anti- tumor responses (Fig. 4).

A neoantigen-based cancer vaccine was subsequently developed using an appropriate design strategy and administered to the patient, with regular monitoring of the immune response and clinical outcomes.

NEO-PV-01, a long peptide cancer vaccine comprising up to 20 neoantigens induced the cytotoxic neoantigen- combined with Nivolumab, speciﬁc T cells in patients with NSCLC, melanoma, or bladder cancer. These activated T cells were responsible for initiating the destruction of tumor cells.97 Recently, an investigational persona- lized mRNA cancer vaccine mRNA was reported to signiﬁcantly reduce the melanoma recurrence risk or death by 44% combined with pembrolizumab, and the combination did not signiﬁcantly increase the risk of severe side effects, which has been granted breakthrough therapy designation by FDA.98 Related studies have shown that although patients experience relapse post-vaccination, lesion progression can be controlled using ICI, suggesting a synergistic effect between neoantigen vaccination and ICI treatment.\\n\\nPatients with minimal residual disease are less affected by production pipeline timeline and the immune mechanisms of suppressive tumors have not yet been fully established, perhaps making them more suitable for vaccine application. Designing an optimal delivery platform, selecting the optimal combination therapy, avoiding immune escape and eliciting a robust T cell immune response remains challenging, and these will be comprehensively addressed in the following review.\\n\\nVACCINE CONSTITUENT AND PLATFORM Precisely delivering antigens to their intended sites presents a signiﬁcant obstacle to effectively developing cancer vaccines. Multiple factors must be considered when selecting an appropriate platform for cancer vaccines, including components and delivery methods. Established delivery methods include DNA, RNA, and peptide vaccines, while newer platforms are being investigated. This section discusses the advantages and limitations of each platform in order to determine the most effective neoantigen-based cancer vaccine delivery system (Table 1).\\n\\nDNA vaccine DNA cancer vaccines are attractive because their efﬁcient manufacturing process. DNA vaccines can simultaneously deliver multiple antigens in the same construct at the same time. The DNA cancer vaccine GX-188E, designed to target HPV-16/HPV-18 E6 and E7, was administrated to patients diagnosed with HPV- positive advanced cervical cancer and displayed a favorable safety proﬁle. Objective remission was achieved in 19 of 60 patients [overall response rate (ORR): 31.7%], among whom 6/60 had complete remission (CR) and 13/60 had partial remission (PR), respectively, showing considerable therapeutic efﬁcacy.39 In a phase 1 non-randomized clinical trial involving 66 patients with advanced HER2/neu-positive breast cancer, a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding the intracellular domain of HER2/neu elicited an antigen-speciﬁc T cell response that persisted even after the vaccination was completed.15 Numerous preclinical studies have explored the potential of DNA vaccines to enhance the antigen- speciﬁc immune response. One innovative approach involves DNA nanodevice vaccines, which are designed to assemble antigen peptides and adjuvants within tumor cells, leading to a potent and enduring T cell response.99\\n\\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\\n\\n(2023) 8:450\\n\\nTherapeutic cancer vaccines: advancements, challenges, and prospects Fan et al.\\n\\nTable 1.

Cyto- solic receptors can recognize double-stranded DNA structures, allowing plasmid DNA vaccines to simultaneously activate innate immunity.100 However, many limitations still exit in the DNA vaccine clinical application. DNA must conquer both extracellular and intracellular barriers to migrate into the cell nucleus, posing a challenge for DNA-based antigen delivery system. Physical methods are the most common administration strategies, includ- ing electroporation, gene gun and sonoporation, which lead to the difﬁculties in clinical promotion.101–103 DNA vaccines have demonstrated limited immunogenicity in clinical trials, despite their effective delivery. Efforts have been made to enhance the efﬁcacy of DNA vaccines through various strategies. These include advancements in the design of DNA vaccine vectors, the incorporation of cytokine adjuvants, and the exploration of innovative non-mechanical delivery methods.104\\n\\nsequences with high codon adaptation indices. mRNA stability is enhanced by optimizing the secondary structure of mRNAs and calculating and selecting mRNA sequences with high minimum free codon adaptation indices.108–110 mRNA is a negatively charged biomolecule that enter the cell through the negatively charged cell membrane to achieve therapeutic effects. Therefore, to reduce the extracellular degradation of naked mRNA by RNA enzymes, several mRNA delivery systems have been designed to lengthen the mRNA improve translation efﬁciency, and circulation time in vivo, increase antigens uptake by APCs.111 Positively charged cationic liposomes binding to negatively charged mRNA contributes to APC endocytosis. Protamine is a polycationic natural peptide with a positive charge that can bind to mRNA to form complexes and maintain mRNA stability.112 The self-adjuvanted mRNA CV9103 coated with protamine, encoding several prostate cancer-speciﬁc TAAs, was safe in patients with prostate cancer, although no clinical beneﬁt was observed in phase 1/2 clinical studies.113\\n\\nenergies while guaranteeing the\\n\\nRNA vaccine The emergency use of two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines brought mRNA vaccines back into the spotlight. The MIT Technology Review released a compilation of the top 10 breakthrough technologies for 2021, with mRNA vaccines ranking ﬁrst due to their dramatic changes in revolutionizing the medical ﬁeld.105 Compared to the risk of integration into the host genome in DNA vaccines, mRNA is produced using in vitro transcription and can be directly translated into protein once they enter the cytoplasm, offering a well-tolerated delivery method without the risk of genome integration.106 The mRNA is also transiently expressed in cells, enabling repeated inoculations.107 Furthermore, mRNA- encoded units are ﬂexible and versatile, making it feasible to encode tumor antigens and immunomodulatory molecules. This ﬂexibility is valuable for inducing both adaptive and innate immunity effectively.\\n\\nTechnical barriers to mRNA vaccines are centered on their molecular design and in vivo delivery efﬁciency. mRNA modiﬁca- tion and the sequence design of the its regulatory and coding regions play a crucial role in determining mRNA stability and translation efﬁciency. The antigen translation efﬁciency can be enhanced using codons preferred by somatic cells to limit the GC content of mRNA sequences and calculating and selecting mRNA\\n\\nSeveral studies have been carried out to access the anti-tumor efﬁcacy of LNP-formulated mRNA neoantigen cancer vaccines. Neoantigens and driver gene mutations were tandemly linked into a single mRNA sequence, coated with LNP, and administered to patients with gastrointestinal cancer. The cancer vaccine could elicit a robust and broad neoantigen-speciﬁc immune response. TCRs targeting KRAS G12D have been isolated and identiﬁed from patients’ blood after tumor vaccine application.114 The latest clinical trial of mRNA-4157 in high-risk melanoma showed that the combination with mRNA-4157 and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) greatly prolonged the distant-metastasis free survival and reduced the risk of developing distant metastases or death by 65% compared to pembrolizumab alone. Owing to these exciting clinical ﬁndings, mRNA-4157 is poised to become the world’s ﬁrst mRNA personalized tumor vaccine to undergo phase 3 clinical study.98 Notably, after the ﬁrst patient was dosed with a vaccine using non-nucleoside modiﬁed RNA for personalized cancer therapies in 2012, BioNTech developed a new class of tailored mRNA therapeutics using multiple mRNA versatile, formats with distinct properties capable of addressing several cancers. Several pipelines targeting TAAs have been developed for NSCLC, HPV-related cancers, melanoma and prostate cancer.22,38 The individualized mRNA neoantigen cancer vaccine BNT122 is being examined in a randomized phase 2 trial as a ﬁrst line\\n\\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\\n\\n(2023) 8:450\\n\\n7\\n\\n8\\n\\nTherapeutic cancer vaccines: advancements, challenges, and prospects Fan et al.\\n\\nFig. 5 Direct delivery of antigen. TAA or TSA, which are the antigens with tumor immunogenicity, could be delivered directly into the body as DNA, RNA, or peptides using different adjuvants.

Vaccines contain- ing 8–12 amino acids derived from tumor antigens include MHC-I- binding short peptides preferably endocytosed, processed, and presented by professional APCs to elicit peptide-speciﬁc T cells.118 Synthetic long peptide (SLP) vaccines typically contain 25–35 amino acids, frequently encompassing multiple epitopes or larger portions of the target protein.119 Therefore, SLP vaccines contain- ing multiple epitopes can elicit broader and more diverse immune responses using longer peptide sequences. This broader response may enhance vaccine effectiveness by targeting a wider range of antigens or strains.120 Utilizing SLPs rather than short peptides can further enhance peptide stability and antigen delivery efﬁciency (Fig. 5).121 However, SLP cancer vaccines have disadvantages such as complex preparation, potential for HLA-restriction, and rapid degradation. Therefore, developing more effective immune formulations is necessary for enhancing neoantigen-derived peptide-speciﬁc immunity.\\n\\nTumor antigens involved in SLP vaccines may have suboptimal immunogenicity, indicating that they may not induce a robust immune response in all individuals. Enhancing the immunogeni- Immune city of SLP vaccines is an area for stimulation adjuvants have been used to enhance co-stimulatory signals to promote local immune cell proliferation in the tumor.122 GM-CSF is a strong adjuvant that can improve T cell priming efﬁciency by recruiting dendritic cells (DCs) into the skin after vaccination.123 However, a phase 3 clinical trial that investigated the combination of GM-CSF plus peptide vaccination did not show a signiﬁcant improvement in recurrence-free survival (RFS) or OS for patients with advanced melanoma.124 The SLP vaccine can induce a robust T cell response with immunomodulatory including polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid-poly- adjuvants,\\n\\nimprovement.\\n\\nL-lysine carboxymethylcellulose (poly-ICLC), cytosine-phosphate- guanine (CPG) and Toll like receptor (TLR). In a phase 1 clinical trial targeting patients with glioblastoma, an innovative strategy involving a vaccine from a pool of pre-manufactured unmutated followed by immunization with a vaccine antigens (APVAC1) derived from neoantigens (APVAC2) elicited a sustained response of central memory CD8+ T cells and predominantly CD4+ T cell responses, which was characterized by multifunctionality and T-helper (Th)1 polarization.125 TLRs are important components of innate immune system, whose agonists expressed in intracellular compartments can trigger potent antiviral and anti-tumor immune responses. Boosting innate immunity through TLR7 or TLR8 are effective antiviral strategy.126 In a study of patients with resected locally advanced melanoma, the SLP vaccine LPV7 containing seven TAA peptides in combination with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA) and agonists for TLR3 (poly-ICLC) and TLR7/8 (resiquimod) induced TAA-speciﬁc T cells, but did not enhance the immune response rate compared to the vaccine alone, indicating that immunogenicity may be enhanced by poly- ICLC plus IFA.127 Although a few clinical studies have investigated different tactics, a good ORR has not been achieved in patients with cancer. Additionally, SLP vaccines may be restricted to individuals with speciﬁc HLA types, limiting their universal applicability.128 Expanding the range of HLA-restricted SLP vaccines or developing strategies to overcome HLA restrictions could increase the number of individuals who will beneﬁt from this cancer vaccine type.\\n\\nNotably, the SLP vaccine research is evolving continuously, and ongoing studies and technological advancements may further improve their design, formulation, and applications.\\n\\nCell-based vaccine Cell-based cancer vaccine is a cancer vaccine that utilizes patient’s own immune cells. DCs are harnessed to both antigens soluble and particulate exogenous states in diverse formats, encompass- ing DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides, or tumor lysates. To augment the antigenicity of vaccines, various carriers such as emulsions, liposomes, and polymeric particulate carriers are employed.129 This uptake is facilitated through techniques like electroporation transduction.130–134 Besides conventional APCs’ or function, isolated DCs are antigen donor cells, transferring to endogenous cross-presenting APCs with multiple layers of co- stimulation and can secrete key cytokines.135 The ﬁrst individual DC cancer vaccine was administrated in 6 patients diagnosed with melanoma. By immunized with a personalized neoantigen pulsed autologous DC vaccine in patients with metastatic lung cancer, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) responded strongly to predicted neoantigens, thus expanding the diversity of alternative therapies for lung cancer.136 In a recent phase 3 clinical trial, an lysate-loaded DC vaccine (DCVax-L) was autologous\\n\\nlentiviral\\n\\ntumor\\n\\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\\n\\n(2023) 8:450\\n\\nincorporated into the standard treatment regimen for both newly diagnosed glioblastoma (nGBM) and recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM). The results revealed that patients with nGBM who received DCVax-L had a median OS of 19.3 months, signiﬁcantly longer than the 16.5 months observed in control groups (HR = 0.80; 98% CI, 0.00–0.94; p = 0.002), demonstrating the substantial extension in long-term survival of patients with nGBM due to DCVax-L. The study also showed that the median OS for 64 patients with rGBM who received DCVax-L was 13.2 months, compared to 7.8 months for those without DCVax-L treatment. These results from the phase 3 clinical trial offer a newfound sense of hope for the treatment of patients with glioblastoma.137\\n\\nOptimizing the methods for generating and manipulating DCs ex vivo can improve their maturation, activation, and antigen- presenting capabilities, immune response. Early DC-based cancer vaccines mainly used PBMC from patients for in vitro isolation and culture.138 However, PBMC- derived DCs have the limitations that not possess all the co- stimulatory molecules and antigen cross-presentation mechan- isms available to other DC subpopulations. DC precursor cells in bone marrow are categorized into plasma cell-like DCs (pDCs) and conventional DCs (cDCs).139 pDCs play a key role in secreting type interferon along with the antigen presentation.140 cDC1s can I cross-present and induce cytotoxic CD8+ T cell immune responses, whereas cDC2s are specialized in presenting soluble antigens, particularly to CD4+ T cells.141 Therefore, efforts to optimize in vitro culture to induce high-quality required DC future DC vaccines subsets become the main challenge for development. Technologies for hematopoietic stem and progeni- tor cells-derived and cord blood monocyte-derived DC subsets are undergoing preclinical investigation.142,143\\n\\nleading to a more potent\\n\\nEnhancing DC vaccines’ lymphoid-homing ability can improve their effectiveness by ensuring optimal migration of DCs into lymphoid tissues, where they can interact with and immune cells, respectively. Chemokine receptors contribute crucially to directing DC migration into lymphoid tissues. C-C chemokine receptor (CCR) 7 mediates mature DCs’ lymphoid homing by binding with C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) 21/19 ligands on the surface of lymphatic endothelial cells, upregulating CCR7 expression on DCs, thereby promoting their migration into the lymph nodes.144 A hybrid nanovaccine exhibited high expression of CCR7 on DC membrane vesicles and enhanced the efﬁciency of lymph node targeting.145 Factors such as TLR agonists, cytokines, or immune stimulatory molecules, can promote DC maturation and activation to further promote DC lymphoid homing.146,147 Immunogenic cell death induces human neutrophil elastase and the TLR3 agonist hiltonol plus breast cancer exosomes to form a DC vaccine that adequately exposed tumor antigens following cDC1 activation in situ and tumor-reactive CD8+ T cell cross-priming.148 Delivering DC vaccines through speciﬁc routes that facilitate their migration to lymphoid tissues, such as intradermal or subcutaneous injections, can enhance their lymphoid homing ability compared to intravenous administration.149 DC vaccines can augment the immune response and improve tumor control with the help of ICI or adoptive T cells.150,151\\n\\nNumerous antigen peptide-DC vaccines are currently under development, and selecting peptides in the pool and their grouping for optimal efﬁcacy should be given more attention. Customizing the neoantigen peptide pool is important to cover t tumor heterogeneity and enhance multiple tumor-speciﬁc target recognition. When selecting antigens for vaccination, it’s crucial to consider competition for antigen recognition at the surface of APCs and the afﬁnity of the selected epitopes.152 After immuniza- tion with complex antigens, a common observation is a preferential induction of immune responses against immunodo- minant epitopes.153 Furthermore, the presence of high variant allele frequency and peptides with strong HLA-binding afﬁnity can impact the efﬁcacy of cytotoxic T cell- mediated immunity.47\\n\\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\\n\\n(2023) 8:450\\n\\nTherapeutic cancer vaccines: advancements, challenges, and prospects Fan et al.\\n\\nSuccessful eradication of tumors necessitates a coordinated response involving both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, although CD8+ in the T cell responses are conventionally regarded as pivotal context of anti-tumor immunity.154 DCs activated with nucleic acid or protein containing multiple antigenic epitopes can trigger MHC class I- and II-biased immune responses, leading to a diverse repertoire of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses.155 The inclusion of a Th epitope can augment DC maturation and the activation of Th cells, further enhancing anti-tumor activity in vivo.156 Further researches and clinical trials should optimize DC vaccines’ immune response intensity and improve their therapeutic outcomes.\\n\\nViral and bacterial vector vaccine Viruses and bacteria possess inherent immunogenicity, and their genetic material can be modiﬁed to incorporate cancer antigens. Recombinant viruses can serve as vectors to inﬁltrate immune cells and deliver substantial quantities of tumor antigens, which consequently trigger the activation of T cells and instigate the initiation of anti-tumor immune responses.157,158 While preclinical studies have shown promise, clinical trials utilizing viral vectors as standalone cancer vaccines have, for the most part, yielded disappointing results.158 Nevertheless, clinical outcomes can be improved when they are combined with other therapies. A phase 2 study showed that T-VEC, an engineered oncolytic herpes simplex 1 virus encoding GM-CSF, combined with standard neoadjuvant therapy in patients with triple negative breast cancer, achieved complete pathologic response in 45.9% of the patients, 89% remained disease-free 2 years post-treatment, and most patients had higher levels of anti-tumor T cells and immune signaling pathways activation.159 Similarly, TG4010, which is a recombinant modiﬁed cowpox virus encoding MUC1 and IL-2, in conjunction with chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC or PANVAC plus docetaxel for patients with metastatic breast cancer clearly offers additional clinical advantages for patients.160,161\\n\\nOver the past century, Busch and Fehleisen et al. ﬁrst reported a link between cancer and bacteria and found that Streptococcus pyogenes infection could lead to tumor regression.162 Currently, using bacteria as carriers to deliver tumor antigens has many advantages. Bacillus is highly active under prevailing anaerobic/ hypoxic conditions [mostly hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME)].163 Some auxotrophic strains, such as Salmonella, are attracted to the TME to absorb metabolic nutrients.164 Summarily, bacteria have several advantages as potential carriers for anti- cancer drugs or gene vaccine delivery. They thrive in a hypoxic TME, are attracted to the tumor for nutrient uptake, and migrate into remote areas of the tumor. These characteristics make them promising candidates for anti-cancer treatment.\\n\\nNovel platform for delivery system Different nano-drug delivery systems are currently being devel- oped with the aim of enhancing the precision targeting of cancer vaccines and improving the uptake of neoantigens by DCs.165–168 These systems include LNPs, exosomes, bacteria-derived outer membrane vesicles, and amphiphilic vaccines. One promising approach is personalized DC-mimicking nanovaccine, including the nanoDC vaccine, using components from Escherichia coli and It efﬁciently delivered TAAs and induced the tumor cells. maturation in bone marrow-derived cells through the stimulatory of the interferon genes signaling pathway. It also exhibited remarkable lymph node homing ability and elicited strong TAA- speciﬁc T cell responses in mice.169 Another way involves the use of lipopolyplex vector, which consists of a bilayer structure with polymer- and phospholipid-encapsulated mRNA forming the inner respectively.170,171 A phase 1 trial core and outer (NCT05198752) was conducted involving patients with advanced solid tumors to explore the lipopolyplex-mRNA vaccine’s safety and immunogenicity.\\n\\nlayer,\\n\\n9\\n\\n10\\n\\nTherapeutic cancer vaccines: advancements, challenges, and prospects Fan et al.\\n\\nOverall, developing these nano-drug delivery systems holds great promise for enhancing the efﬁcacy of cancer vaccines by improving the delivery efﬁciency of neoantigens to DC cells in lymph nodes. These approaches have the potential to signiﬁcantly enhance the generation of antigen-speciﬁc T cell responses, which could ultimately improve clinical outcomes for patients with solid tumors.\\n\\nCLINICAL TRIAL LANDSCAPE Clinical studies of cancer vaccines are mainly conducted in patients with advanced solid tumors, with safety, immunogenicity and clinical beneﬁts as the endpoints. As of July 2023, 1847 clinical trials have been registered on the United States National Library of Medicine’s ClinicalTrials.gov website with the keyword “cancer vaccine”, of which 947 have been completed, and 224 are actively recruiting. Neoantigen-based cancer vaccine research accounts for the research. Table 2 presents the only a small portion of representative relevant clinical studies. Current ﬁndings indicate that the use of cancer vaccines alone does not yield effective outcomes in prolonged patient survival, although antigen-speciﬁc T cell immune responses have been detected in most clinical trials. Therefore, enhancing T cell activation and anti-tumor efﬁcacy is the most signiﬁcant therapeutic challenge.\\n\\nCOMBINED THERAPY Speciﬁc combined strategies have been devised to address diverse treatment challenges considering the distinctive patholo- gical characteristics of each tumor, different drug resistance mechanisms, and the advantages and disadvantages of distinct vaccine platforms. Patients with advanced cancer, particularly those with multiline therapy, frequently encounter a high tumor burden, multiple drug resistance, and immune deﬁciency. Achieving disease remission by simultaneously reducing the tumor load and enhancing the body’s anti-tumor immunity has been the primary aim in these patients (Fig. 6). Consequently, several combination strategies have been implemented to induce tumor remission by minimizing the tumor burden and boosting anti-tumor immunity. The initial step involves surgery, chemother- apy, or radiotherapy to reduce or eliminate the tumor cells. The subsequent stage focuses on establishing immunological memory to prevent tumor recurrence and stimulate speciﬁc immunity to eradicate any remaining tumor cells through vaccination. This comprehensive approach can improve clinical outcomes and reduce the risk of disease progression.\\n\\nChemotherapy Chemotherapy can directly affect tumor cells and enhance therapeutic efﬁciency through immune modulation. Marij et al. demonstrated that an SLP therapeutic cancer vaccine plus carboplatin and paclitaxel improved survival rates in mice.172 This improvement was attributed to chemotherapy-induced changes in bone marrow cell population composition. Subsequently, these ﬁnding were further validated in clinical trial (NCT02128126), where the combination of the HPV16 SLP vaccine ISA101 with chemotherapy not only depleted the abnormal myeloid cells, but also lead to increased T cell proliferation in response to recall antigens and resulted in a strong and sustained antigen-speciﬁc T cell response in HPV16-positive advanced stage cervical cancer patients, which was associated with the clinical beneﬁt.172,173 These ﬁndings demonstrate that chemotherapy can modulate immune responses and enhance cancer vaccine efﬁcacy.\\n\\nImmune checkpoint inhibitor Recently, treatment ICIs have shown promise as cancer approaches. However, the effectiveness of ICI therapy remains limited since only a few patients beneﬁt from it owing to\\n\\nresponse.174 Cancer inadequate pre-existing cytotoxic T cell vaccines can active T cells to transform the tumor immune microenvironment (“cold” to “hot” tumor). Combining ICIs with cancer vaccines presents an enticing strategy for enhancing the immune therapy response, warranting further exploration in future clinical studies. A personalized SLP cancer vaccine, NEO- PV-01, led to major pathological responses in 9 patients with melanoma with limited or only partial responses to nivolumab. Moreover, NEO-PV-01 plus nivolumab induced epitope spread, leading to the release of neoantigens that provided new targets for T cells.97 Further clinical investigations may establish NEO-PV- 01 plus chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 as a potential ﬁrst-line treatment for non-squamous NSCLC.175 Despite the immuno- suppression caused by pemetrexed plus carboplatin, all trial patients generated a robust immune response and the MHC II expression in the TME post-vaccination, thereby developing a strong CD4+ T cell response. Epitope spread toward the most common driver mutations KRAS G12C and G12V was found in 7 out of 19 patients.175 In another phase 1b trial (NCT03289962), the efﬁcacy of an RNA-lipoplex neoantigen-based vaccine named BNT122 combined with atezolizumab was assessed in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Among the 144 patients enrolled in the trial, 73% exhibited an ex vivo immune response after receiving the combination therapy. The vaccine- speciﬁc T cells were detected at frequencies exceeding 5% in peripheral blood and displayed a T effector memory phenotype with high PD-1 expression levels. The majority of adverse events reported were of grade 1/2 and no dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were observed. Tumor assessment in 108 patients revealed a disease control rate of 57%, with 1 patient achieving a complete remission.115 response and 8 patients experiencing partial it’s worth noting that initial clinical trials involving However, patients with advanced cancers treated with personalized neoantigen cancer vaccines in combination with ICIs did not demonstrate superior ORRs compared to ICIs alone.176 These daunting clinical results were likely related to the late tumor stage and heavy pretreatment. Therefore, further studies should identify candidate patients and appropriate tumor stages for this combination therapy.\\n\\nThe aforementioned clinical trials are limited by their single-arm design, making it difﬁcult to solely attribute the observed cytotoxic T cells, epitope spread, and clinical efﬁcacy to the cancer vaccines. Randomized trials comparing cancer vaccine combined with ICIs to ICIs alone are crucial to pinpoint the functional relevance of the cancer vaccine. Recent groundbreak- ing information highlights the success of a phase 2b clinical trial conducted by Moderna, involving their personalized cancer vaccine mRNA-4157 combined with pembrolizumab in patients with resected stage III/IV melanoma. Notably, the combination strategy achieved the primary endpoint, leading to a signiﬁcantly reduced risk of recurrence and death (hazard ratio=0.56 [95% CI, 0.31–1.08], p = 0.0266).98 Moreover, several randomized controlled clinical trials are currently underway to investigate the concurrent utilization of cancer vaccines and ICIs as a ﬁrst-line treatment. The objective of these trials is to ascertain whether the synergistic integration of cancer vaccines and ICIs can augment the anti- tumor effectiveness of cancer vaccines (NCT03815058 and NCT03897881).\\n\\nDOSAGE AND THE ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION Understanding the driving forces behind T cell activation, subgroup differentiation and long-term memory development are crucial to comprehensively understand cancer vaccine applications. Maximizing the immune response and antitumor efﬁcacy of vaccination requires careful evaluation of the optimal dosing, administration route, and frequency in preclinical and clinical trials.\\n\\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\\n\\n(2023) 8:450\\n\\nr a e y\\n\\nt r a t S\\n\\n3 2 0 2\\n\\n3 2 0 2\\n\\n2 2 0 2\\n\\n0 2 0 2\\n\\ns r o t a g i t s e v n\\n\\n&\\n\\np r a h

combination therapies after the immunization of cancer vaccine in patient. ICIs unblock immunosuppression and stimulate T cell activation by blocking signaling pathways on the surface of T cells and cancer cells. Conventional therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, complement this process by directly affecting tumor cells or indirectly by eliminating immune suppressor cells. Different therapy combinations can activate effector T-cells, enhancing the clinical efﬁcacy of neoantigen cancer vaccines. ICIs Immune checkpoint inhibitors, APC Antigen presentation cell, PD-1 Programmed cell death protein 1, PD-L1 Programmed cell death-ligand 1, CTLA4 Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4\\n\\nOptimal drug concentrations Determining the appropriate dose is of utmost importance since the vaccine at a low dose may render the antigen ineffective, whereas a higher dose could result in DLT, cytokine-releasing syndrome, or a strong innate immune response.127 Previous clinical trials have demonstrated that a higher vaccination dose within the safety range improved immune response and anti- tumor efﬁcacy.22,177 The antigen dose was synchronized with the initial cytotoxic T cell response and the subsequent generation of memory T cell.178 Immunized mice exposed to high antigen concentrations produced T cells with lower functional effector capabilities, while those stimulated with very low antigen concentrations exhibited signiﬁcantly higher functional avidity.179\\n\\nThe route of administration Besides the dose, the delivery route is a critical variable to consider. Each delivery route has its set of challenges that inﬂuence the best delivery method to overcome (Table 2).180 For example, intradermal injection facilitates efﬁcient antigen delivery by the Langerhans cells and mesenchymal DCs in the epidermis and dermis, respectively.181 Skeletal muscle only contains a few immune cells; therefore, conventional vaccines frequently contain\\n\\nadjuvants that can arouse an inﬂammatory response at the injection site to recruit APCs to induce an anti-tumor response by injection.182 The intravenous administration of intramuscular cancer vaccines faces difﬁculties, such as rapid drug degradation and serum protein aggregation.183 The stability and uptake ratio of nucleic acid vaccine can be improved by carrier packaging. Biodistribution after intravenous administration is also crucial; for example, cationic LNP-mRNA vaccines primarily target the liver after into liver- targeted therapies.184 Different vaccination methods may result in varied antigen accumulation and immune responses at distinct sites in the body. For instance, vaccines with human serum albumin as an adjuvant showed stronger Th2 effects following oral primary immunization in mouse models compared to immuniza- tion via intramuscular or subcutaneous routes.185 A DNA vaccine encoding key rheumatoid arthritis autoantigens administered intramuscularly reduced the disease incidence and severity better than subcutaneously and intravenously, without local accumula- tion.186 Direct viruses, immunostimulant-carrying mRNAs, and activated autologous or allogeneic DCs to the tumor site can lead to immediate TME alterations without requiring antigen prediction.187,188 However,\\n\\nsystemic administration, providing insights\\n\\ninjecting\\n\\nadjuvants,\\n\\ntumor-lysing\\n\\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\\n\\n(2023) 8:450\\n\\nthis approach is suitable for only individuals with treatable conditions.189\\n\\nAdditionally, antigen expression and delivery can be limited by lymph node drainage. Multiple-site injections have shown promise in addressing this issue. For instance, multiple-site injections of rabies vaccines increased virus-neutralizing antibody titers in the human body.190 Similarly, distributing a cancer vaccination dose lymphatic drainage areas could enhance antigen- over several speciﬁc T cell responses.191 This simple and cost-effective strategy holds the potential to improve the effectiveness of cancer vaccines.\\n\\nFurthermore, insights into antigen kinetics can provide valuable information for further improvements in clinical trials, and mouse models can also be instrumental. By administering different vaccination schedules at a ﬁxed cumulative antigen dose, researchers can determine the most effective antigenic stimula- tion of CD8+ T cells. Research has shown that antigenic stimulation that increased exponentially over days stimulated antiviral immunity more effectively than a single or multiple doses with daily equal dosages.192 The administration timing, total dose, and prime and boost intervals were thoroughly studied to justify the initial clinical program.21 However, because of insufﬁcient large-scale clinical trials for cancer vaccines and the high degree of heterogeneity among patients with cancers, obtaining accurate and stable dose-response relationships remains challenging. Therefore, optimal experimental models should be explored to clarify the ideal dosage and delivery method for each cancer vaccine to provide the maximum clinical beneﬁt for patients.\\n\\nCLINICAL CHALLENGES Although an increase of anti-tumor effector cells have been detected after vaccination, only modest clinical beneﬁts have been achieved in small-scale populations. Which variables restrict cancer vaccine efﬁcacy? What difﬁculties do the existing clinical applications encounter? The following section will focus on the current clinical challenges associated with cancer vaccines.\\n\\nAnimal models and preclinical innovations It is a great challenge to study the interactions between immune cells and tumors as well as to assess the alterations in immune cell phenotype and function after anti-tumor therapies due to the intricacies of the human immune system and the complexity of the TME. While mouse models are invaluable for gaining fundamental insights into basic biological processes, they have limitations when it comes to investigating human tumor biology, the intricate TME, and the mechanisms underlying resistance to immunological therapy. These limitations underscore the impor- tance of combining insights from mouse models with clinical research to develop a comprehensive understanding of cancer and its treatment.193\\n\\nHumanized mice have begun to fulﬁll this gap by generating mice with Prkdcscid mutation, Rag1/Rag2 deﬁciency or disruption of the IL2rg locus disruption to reduce host innate and adaptive immunity.194 These severely immunodeﬁcient mice support the growth of cell line-derived xenografts (CDX) and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) after reconstruction of the human immune system. Several key aspects of humanized mice restrict their application in cancer vaccine research, including the under- development of mature humanized host immune cell populations (particularly T cells and plasmacytoid DCs for cancer vaccines), insufﬁcient HLA molecules in standard immune-deﬁcient mouse strains, and absence of well-developed lymph node structures and germinal centers, leading to an inability to generate antigen- speciﬁc cellular immunity.195 In addition, the accurate prediction of neoantigens relies on comparative calculations of tumor tissue and PBMC sequencing data from the same donor, which this dual humanized strategy depends on the availability of cancer patients\\n\\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\\n\\n(2023) 8:450\\n\\nTherapeutic cancer vaccines: advancements, challenges, and prospects Fan et al.\\n\\nwilling to provide blood and tumor samples for preclinical studies. Currently, commonly used mouse models for the immune system humanization include the human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (huPBMC) humanized mice model and the human hemato- poietic stem cell (huHSC) humanized mice model. huPBMC humanized mice model can rapidly reconstitute mature and activated human T-lymphocytes, but cannot successfully recon- stitute the myeloid system including DCs, or present antigens.194 The anti-tumor effect of carbonic anhydrase 9 antibody was tested using allogeneic huPBMC in NOD/SCID/IL2Rγ (-/-) mice by transplanting a novel orthotopic renal cell carcinoma CDX and found that the antibody of this tumor-speciﬁc antigen inhibited tumor growth.196 Transplanted human PBMC mediates acute graft-versus-host disease and body weight loss. In severe cases, death owing to graft-versus-host disease signiﬁcantly impacts drug efﬁcacy experiments by shortening the vaccination time window.197 The huHSC humanized mice model is able to rebuild various human immune cells, such as T, B, and myeloid cells, however, the incomplete development of mature human innate cell lineages, coupled with the HLA expression, imposes limita- tions on the use of huHSC models in cancer vaccine studies.198 In many studies, the introduction of transgenic expression of HLA molecules has led to improved development and survival of human T cells, making these models more suitable for investigat- ing cancer vaccines.199 An example of this strategy was the transduction of a lentiviral vector containing HLA-A*0201 and A*2402-restricted TCR speciﬁc for the WT1 antigen into CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells to express HLA-A24. With this approach, WT1-speciﬁc CD8+ T cells were detected in both thymus and these mice.200 Based on the precise peripheral sequencing of CDX or PDX, rapid construction of humanized mice using matched-HLA human PBMCs or hematopoietic stem cells allows for a more comprehensive immune system through strategies, such as thymus transplantation, which is still important for assessing the immunogenicity and tumor-suppressing efﬁ- ciency of future neoantigen cancer vaccines.\\n\\ntissues of\\n\\nled to many research on cancer vaccines with innovations in preclinical technological advancements. For example, high-throughput technologies can accelerate the discovery of neoantigens, and technologies, such as artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning, can accelerate data analysis and simulation prediction to assist vaccine development decision-making process (described in detail in the section “neoantigen cancer vaccine”). Gene editing technologies can also optimize vaccine design and screen vaccine targets. For example, researchers found that tumor cells sensitive to interferon-β were transformed into drug-resistant tumor cells through by knocking out CRISPR-Cas9 technology, which subsequently caused them to release the immunomodulatory factors interferon-β and GM- CSF.201 These modiﬁed therapeutic tumor cells can effectively activate signaling pathways speciﬁc to antigen-triggered T cell activation and stimulate the trafﬁcking of immune cells, which may be beneﬁcial for the further application of cancer vaccines.201 Developing an appropriate in vitro assessment model to characterize the function of antigen-speciﬁc T cells is critical to therapeutic cancer vaccine research. Two promising potential models are PDX in highly immunodeﬁcient mice and patient- derived organoids.148,202 PDX in highly immunodeﬁcient mice offers a valuable platform for evaluating the anti-tumor efﬁcacy of antigen-speciﬁc T cells. This model preserves the endogenous expression, natural processing, and presentation of neoepitopes, the human tumor making it a reliable representation of environment.203 In contrast, 3D patient-derived organoids repre- sent another innovative preclinical therapeutic model, involving a tumor organoid-T cell co-culture system, that maintains tumor heterogeneity and the TME necessary for neoantigen presentation and T cell recognition.

Immunosuppressive cells in the TME, such as Tregs, M2 macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, PD-L1-positive DCs, cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts, and tumor cells form a suppressive ecological niche at the tumor site through the expression of immunosuppressive signals.

Therefore, strategies from the following four perspectives may effectively reverse the suppressive TME toward improving the vaccine’s anti-tumor efﬁcacy: (1) immunosuppres- sive cell depletion, (2) immune checkpoint inhibition, (3) targeting the tumor structure, and (4) enhancing T cell activation or survival signaling.\\n\\nOvercome the suppression of tumor immune microenvironment The tumor microenvironment is a complex system that encom- passes a variety of immune components, including both innate and adaptive immune cells, extracellular immune factors, and cell surface molecules.205 However, the presence of immunosuppres- sive cells, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), M2 macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), programmed cell death- ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive DCs, and cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts creates an inhibitory niche within the TME that protects the tumor from immune attack.206 These cells in the TME release abundant immunosuppressive signals, including PD-L1, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and vascular endothelial growth factor, into the microenvironment and act directly or indirectly on effector T cells to suppress tumor immunity.207 For instance, Tregs inhibit the activation and proliferation of effector T cells, whereas M2 macrophages promote tumor growth by inducing angiogenesis and tissue remodeling. PD-L1-positive DCs suppress T cell function by presenting antigens to them, and cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts secrete extracellular matrix components that physically restrict T cell inﬁltration into the tumor.207 Figure 7 summarizes the roles of the different components in creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment.\\n\\nTumors often promote immunosuppressive cell subpopula- tion differentiation or activation to evade immune attacks. Targeting and eliminating these immunosuppressive cells can improve tumor vaccine efﬁcacy. For example, low continuous doses of cyclophosphamide selectively target and eliminate Tregs while promoting Th17 differentiation, thereby supporting host anti-tumor immunity.208,209 The stand of care chemother- apy with carboplatin/paclitaxel can deplete HPV-speciﬁc Treg and MDSCs, which may enhance the efﬁcacy of HPV16 SLP cancer vaccine.173 Recent approaches have exploited macro- phage plasticity by reprogramming M1 macrophages to an M2 anti-tumor phenotype, through targeting molecules, including PI3K, STAT3 and IDO-1.210–212 Developing immunotherapy- based combination therapies (e.g., CTLA4, PD-1/PD-L1) has emerged as a prominent trend in the ﬁeld of cancer vaccine application (discussed in the combined therapy section above). Antigen-speciﬁc T cells generated by cancer vaccines often express suppressor molecules, and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is involved in signaling mediated by the TCR recognition of antigens, providing a mechanism through which tumor cells can resist attacks by T cells.213,214 Therefore, blocking the PD-1/PD- L1 signaling pathway can release the immune system “brake”, reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment. The TME contains a plethora of immunosuppressive cytokines, mainly TGF-β and IL-10.

Cancer cells manipulate the TME to support their growth and survival, which includes stimulating angiogenesis for continuous access to oxygen and nutrients. Additionally, inhibiting angiogenesis using antibodies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor or multi-tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors can inhibit neoangiogenesis and induce the tumor vasculature normalization, activating the tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes’ inﬁltration into the TME.218 Numerous studies have revealed that modulating the T cell signaling pathway can help protect T lymphocytes from the immunosuppressive effects inhibiting cholesterol esteriﬁcation in of TME. For example, T cells by targeting ACAT1 enhanced their effector function and proliferation, whereas mRNA-encoded constitutively active STINGV155M maximized CD8+ T cell responses.219,220\\n\\nto promote anti-tumor\\n\\nIn summary, effector immune cells must overcome multiple suppressive networks and activation barriers within TME. Targeted inhibition of pivotal factors within these networks can establish a favorable environment for anti-tumor immune responses, ulti- mately improving cancer vaccines efﬁcacy.\\n\\nIdentify the optimal candidates and expand the therapeutic range of cancer vaccines Immune evasion is a prominent characteristic of cancer, and therapies aimed at restoring immune surveillance have shown signiﬁcant effectiveness especially in cancers with a high tumor the TMB, mutation burden (TMB). theoretically, the more non-synonymous tumor cell mutations that can be detected and the more neoantigens that may contain immunogenic properties bound to MHC.205 “High- quality” neoantigens crucially elicit a strong and sustained T cell immune response. Identifying suitable patients for neoantigen cancer vaccine application involves accurate HLA typing, evaluating antigens serological activity, and assessing the patient’s neoantigen merits.9 Consequently, tumors with high including melanoma, NSCLC, and bladder cancer, have TMB, focus of neoantigen-based cancer vaccine been the initial research, and early data have shown promising efﬁcacy.40,97,221 However, potential immunogenic neoantigens require further exploration to broaden cancer vaccine application for tumors with low TMB, including glioblastoma and microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC).130 Studies have found that all tumors in patients with MSS CRC contain HLA-I-type clonal neoantigens; however, these were expressed at low levels. The low expression of these neoantigens contributes to poor T cell inﬁltration and ICI responses.222 Since insufﬁcient antigenic stimulation may cause early immune escape from cancer, therapeutic vaccination can be employed using therapeutic priming, including anti-CD40 and ICIs.222 With the breakthroughs in immunotherapy, particularly the success of ICIs in inﬂamed tumors, the scope of immunotherapy is expanding to encompass tumors. Even within immune-excluded and immune-desert tumors with low passenger mutation rates, advanced high- throughput techniques have enabled identifying immunogenic neoepitopes detectable by CD8+ T cells. For example, despite the low mutation rate in PDAC, pathogenic germline variants were identiﬁed using the MSK-IMPACT panel, and personalized mRNA cancer vaccines were established to induce individual immune response against neoantigens speciﬁc to this tumor.116,223 Research has demonstrated that cancer vaccines can activate cytotoxic T cells in non-inﬂammatory tumors displaying immune achieved through the exclusion or desert phenotypes,\\n\\nIn addition,\\n\\nthe higher\\n\\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\\n\\n(2023) 8:450\\n\\nTherapeutic cancer vaccines: advancements, challenges, and prospects Fan et al.\\n\\nintegration of integrates next-generation sequencing and mass spectroscopy data.\\n\\nin the pipelines primarily in patients with advanced tumors. Patients who have undergone one or several prior regimens may encounter challenges in responding to cancer vaccines because of severe damage to bone marrow function and immune system suppres- sion caused by multiple drug therapies.97,224 To address these issues and provide treatment access to more patients with advanced disease, there is a need to expand the use of cancer lines to ﬁrst-line treatment. vaccines from later Therefore, the risk of patients becoming severely ill to receive treatment can be reduced.175 However, cancer vaccine efﬁcacy in advanced diseases is limited because of disease progression and these patients’ poor physical condition. Another important consideration is the personalized cancer vaccine manufacturing time, which typically takes at least 2 months. This duration renders these vaccines unaffordable for patients with advanced stage cancer. One approach to tackle this challenge is to focus on early-stage diseases where patients have not yet established immune tolerance. Utilizing neoadjuvant therapy in patients with early-stage cancer and employing cancer vaccines in post- operative therapy may extend the therapeutic time window and maximize individual neoantigen cancer vaccine efﬁcacy under conditions of load and better physical scores. Therefore, cancer vaccine-related studies are more desirable in the disease or postoperative patients, the early stages of intraepithelial neoplasia and including HPV-related cervical high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.225,226 Recent advances in cancer vaccines have been promising. For instance, BioNTech reported preliminary clinical data from a phase 1 trial of an individual mRNA-based neoantigen-speciﬁc immunother- apy combined with atezolizumab and mFOLFIRINOX chemother- apy in patients with resected PDAC. This approach generated cytotoxic and durable neoantigen-speciﬁc T cells, potentially delaying recurrence in patients with PDCA.116 Similarly, Mod- erna/Merck’s personalized cancer vaccine mRNA-4157 in combi- for nation with pembrolizumab as an adjuvant patients with resected stage III/IV melanoma signiﬁcantly reduced the risk of recurrence and death, providing further evidence regarding the potential for the future commercializa- tion of personalized neoantigen cancer vaccines in postoperative patients.98\\n\\nCancer vaccines are under development\\n\\ntreatment\\n\\nlow tumor\\n\\ntreatment\\n\\nEvaluation of clinical outcomes Currently, there is only one approved cancer vaccine on the market, while all other cancer vaccine-related products remain under pre-marketing clinical studies. The success of these clinical trials hinges on the careful design of trial endpoints. As shown in Table 2, ensuring safety is paramount, necessitating diligent monitoring and evaluation of safety indicators, including adverse events and side effects, to safeguard the patient’s well-being. Designing clinical trials with a greater focus on the clinical beneﬁts to patients is crucial since prolonged patient survival is the most satisfactory and trustworthy outcome of a cancer vaccine efﬁcacy assessment. Although initial small-scale clinical trials have shown modest improvements in cancer vaccine efﬁcacy among patients with tumors, most lacked the rigor of a two-arm randomized controlled trial. Consequently, evaluating the clinical beneﬁts of cancer vaccines for patients with tumors is crucial through large- scale phase 3 randomized controlled clinical trials. These trials can adopt efﬁcacy indicators including PFS, OS, and RFS as the gold standard for evaluating vaccine efﬁcacy. A recent clinical trial design led by Merck and Moderna, involved a phase 3, randomized, double-blind study that evaluated the combination the efﬁcacy of of mRNA-4157 and pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab alone in 1089 patients with melanoma In this trial, RFS was the primary endpoint, (NCT05933577).\\n\\n17\\n\\n18\\n\\nTherapeutic cancer vaccines: advancements, challenges, and prospects Fan et al.\\n\\ninto the product’s efﬁcacy and\\n\\nproviding valuable insight validating its potential for melanoma treatment.\\n\\nThe fundamental objective of cancer vaccines is to activate the immune system against tumor cells. Several immune metrics are considered to evaluate the immunological efﬁcacy of cancer vaccine, and assessing antigen immunogenicity after vaccination has become the important endpoints in clinical trials. Interferon-γ Enzyme-Linked Immuno-Spot (ELISpot) could identify T cell clones respond to the speciﬁc antigen epitopes, while ﬂow that cytometry analysis of peptide-MHC conjugates (e.g., tetramer) enables detecting the number of neoantigen-speciﬁc T cells in PBMCs.97,116 Researchers have previously used intracellular to determine activation status and cytokine staining (ICS) cytotoxicity of T cells after in vitro stimulation with matched epitopes or tumor- inﬁltrating lymphocytes and peripheral blood T cells can be informative, particularly regarding T cell phenotypes and antigen- speciﬁc interactions. Bulk TCR sequencing is a valuable tool that offers insight the TCR repertoire.228 Therefore, this technique provides an overall view of T cell populations that respond to tumor neoantigen vaccines when many T cells are analyzed together. Additionally, single-cell TCR sequencing analysis is a more focused approach that provides a precise and detailed characterization of individual T cell responses.229 Another study identiﬁed antigen-speciﬁc clonal expansion by TCR sequencing of T cells cultured for a short period after peptide stimulation and combined it with a bioinformatics platform (MANAFEST).230 This cutting-edge method reveals dynamic changes at in cancer neoantigen vaccine-speciﬁc T cells. This demonstrates the high speciﬁcity and efﬁcacy of T cell immune responses triggered by tumor neoantigen vaccines at the cellular level. Moreover, studies follow-up after neoantigen vaccination in have shown that patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and monitoring of individualized neoantigen mutations in peripheral blood circulat- ing tumor DNA could facilitate real-time evaluation of the clinical response.228 Longitudinal analysis of blood samples can also provide relevant information on changes in the immune system dynamics over time.\\n\\nlysates.67,227 TCR sequencing of\\n\\ntumor\\n\\ninto the diversity and clonality of\\n\\nthe clonotypic level\\n\\nEpitope spreading refers to releasing additional epitopes after cancer cell destruction using cancer vaccines, thereby diversifying the T cell repertoire and eliciting a broader T cell immune response. A previous study demonstrated that individual neoanti- gen cancer vaccines can elicit responses against KRAS G12C and G12V mutations, and long PFS is associated with epitope spreading.97,175 Thus, epitope spreading has become an indis- pensable marker of vaccine effectiveness. Additionally, a re-biopsy tissue post-vaccine treatment can be analysis of conducted to provide evidence of vaccine effectiveness. The efﬁcacy assessment of the major pathological responses can be performed by analyzing the residual tumor content of the tissue core biopsies pre-and post-treatment. The inﬁltration of CD3+ T cells at the tumor site post-treatment was associated with a good clinical response.97 In the future, novel technologies, such as multiplex immunoﬂuorescence, slide-DNA-seq, and TARGET-seq, will enable a more reﬁned characterization of tissue changes following vaccination. These advancements will provide dynamic and precise predictions of disease outcomes and immunotherapy responses.\\n\\nthe tumor\\n\\ntumor\\n\\nBy combining comprehensive clinical and immunological assessments, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the effects of cancer vaccines on patient outcomes and immune system activation. This data-driven approach not only paves the way for potential regulatory approvals but also opens doors to advancements in cancer treatment. Furthermore, with solid evidence from well-designed clinical trials, cancer vaccines have the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment and improve patient outcomes, providing new hope for the ﬁghting cancer.\\n\\nAccelerate vaccine manufacturing Cancer vaccine technologies are still in the early stages of formats have been explored in development, and various preclinical and clinical studies for off-the-shelf and personalized cancer vaccines. Optimal delivery conditions, including the choice of adjuvant and schedule of administration, should be established for all forms of personalized neoantigen vaccines. The vaccine design will signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the strength of the immune response to candidate neoantigens.\\n\\nThe manufacture of cancer vaccines is a signiﬁcant challenge. Shared antigen cancer vaccines can be mass-produced as ready-to- use, reducing production times and costs. Since each personalized neoantigen vaccine is treated as a stand-alone drug, demanding for rapid drug production, scalability, and cost control is needed to enable rapid clinical application. This differs from the conventional pharmaceutical development approach, focusing on bulk upscaling. Therefore, adopting a synthetic vaccine technology that facilitates robust, fast and cost-effective production through a simple, invariant, and good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant process is essential to address these complexities. Favorable solutions may involve completely digitizing the production pro- cesses, platforming the production quality control, modularizing production plants, and intelligentizing production hardware.231 There is a need for better coordination of every aspect of production and preparation, automated management tracking of every step, and acceleration of the entire vaccine preparation. These advance- ments have enabled the creation of scaled parallelized miniaturized production lines and signiﬁcantly enhanced the overall efﬁciency and accessibility of cancer vaccines for clinical applications.\\n\\nCONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES Over the past few decades, a substantially enhanced under- standing of how cancer cells elude the immune system detection led to remarkable progress in cancer immunotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive cell therapies have demon- strated tumor regression-inducing ability inpatient with hemato- logical and solid tumor cohorts. These advances have showcased the viability of immunotherapy, and cancer vaccine development has entered a phase of rapid growth by mimicking natural immunity. Therapeutic cancer vaccines represent an innovative trajectory for future immunotherapy, primarily because of their safety proﬁle, speciﬁcity, and ability to confer enduring immune memory. Cancer vaccine research is undergoing an intense surge in early-stage clinical investigations globally. Predeﬁned antigen cancer vaccines targeting TAA have been investigated in prior research, although their efﬁcacy is limited. Personalized cancer vaccines targeting neoantigens have gar- nered signiﬁcant interest. However, their widespread application remains constrained by challenges, such as the intricacy of neoantigen identiﬁcation, complexities of rapid manufacturing, and intricacies of detecting clinically meaningful immune responses. Less-successful clinical trials have gained valuable insights, guiding the necessary adjustments and modiﬁcations to enhance their performance. These endeavors underscore the dynamic nature of research and the iterative process required to propel cancer vaccines toward their full therapeutic potential.\\n\\ntumor\\n\\nFuture advancement of the clinical efﬁcacy of therapeutic cancer vaccines is concentrated in several key areas, including identifying immunogenic neoantigens, optimizing vectors and delivery plat- forms, and surmounting the immunosuppressive TME. Next- generation sequencing, increased computing power, and advanced algorithms have signiﬁcantly enabled identifying highly immuno- genic neoantigens. Ongoing research is dedicated to reﬁning vaccine technologies, including exploring diverse expression formats, improving co-stimulation components, and identifying suitable prime-boost approaches. Optimally selecting a delivery system is crucial to amplify antigen immunogenicity and facilitate the entry of\\n\\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\\n\\n(2023) 8:450\\n\\nthe antigen and an activation signal into APCs. Strategically incorporating immune checkpoint inhibitors and other treatment regimens is another avenue for exploration. These combined approaches can counteract the immunosuppressive milieu of the TME and mitigate immunotherapy resistance development. How- ever, the precise composition of combination therapies, and their sequence and dosage, require further investigation and reﬁnement. Establishing a tumor-speciﬁc cytotoxic T cell response remains a pivotal challenge in cancer immunotherapy. The overarching objective of these multifaceted strategies involves selecting a treatment regimen that stimulates effective, durable, and tumor- speciﬁc immunity in patients with cancer and prolongs their survival through cancer vaccines. The convergence of innovative approaches, strategic candidate selection, and reﬁned adminis- tration protocols hold the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment, paving the way for a new era of therapeutic cancer vaccines. We will witness the successful emergence of numerous therapeutic cancer vaccines with ongoing advancements.\\n\\nDATA AVAILABILITY All relevant data are within the manuscript and its additional ﬁles.\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China 81573008 and 81860547 (Chunyan Dong) and National Natural Science Foundation of China 82203861 (Wanlu Cao).

Ott1,2,3,4\\u2009✉\\n\\nAbstract | Within the past decade, the field of immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of many cancers with the development and regulatory approval of various immune- checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapies in diverse indications. Another promising approach to cancer immunotherapy involves the use of personalized vaccines designed to trigger de novo T cell responses against neoantigens, which are highly specific to tumours of individual patients, in order to amplify and broaden the endogenous repertoire of tumour- specific T cells. Results from initial clinical studies of personalized neoantigen- based vaccines, enabled by the availability of rapid and cost- effective sequencing and bioinformatics technologies, have demonstrated robust tumour- specific immunogenicity and preliminary evidence of antitumour activity in patients with melanoma and other cancers. Herein, we provide an overview of the complex process that is necessary to generate a personalized neoantigen vaccine, review the types of vaccine- induced T cells that are found within tumours and outline strategies to enhance the T cell responses. In addition, we discuss the current status of clinical studies testing personalized neoantigen vaccines in patients with cancer and considerations for future clinical investigation of this novel, individualized approach to immunotherapy.\\n\\n1Department of Medical Oncology, Dana- Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.\\n\\n2Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.\\n\\n3Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.\\n\\n4Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.\\n\\n✉e- mail: patrick_ott@ dfci.harvard.edu\\n\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/ s41571-020-00460-2\\n\\nVaccines have traditionally been used for the prevention of infectious diseases; however, the ability of such agents to elicit and amplify antigen- specific immune responses has long been recognized as a potentially valuable tool for the treatment of cancer. Early therapeutic vacci- nation strategies focused on self- antigens abnormally expressed or overexpressed in tumours, termed tumour- associated antigens (TAAs), were largely unsuccessful in generating clinically effective antitumour immune responses, probably owing to the TAA- specific T cells being subject to central and/or peripheral tolerance1. Such TAAs can also be expressed to some extent in nonmalignant tissues, which raises the risk of vaccine- induced autoimmune toxicities1. Thus, these early stud- ies highlighted the lack of tumour specificity and poor immuno genicity as fundamental issues to overcome in developing cancer vaccines.\\n\\nMutations occurring in tumour cells can gener- ate novel epitopes of self- antigens, which are referred to as neoepitopes or neoantigens. The advent of next- generation sequencing has provided opportunities to identify these tumour- specific mutations in individual patients in a timely and cost- effective manner and to explore therapies that target the mutated proteins in clin- ical studies. Additionally, the development of algorithms\\n\\nfor the prediction of MHC class I (MHC I)- binding epitopes has paved the way for the identification of potentially immunogenic neoepitopes. Together, these scientific advances have enabled the generation of per- sonalized therapeutic cancer vaccines that are tailored to the tumours of individual patients.\\n\\nVaccines predicated on neoantigens rather than traditionally used TAAs have several advantages. First, neoantigens are exclusively expressed by tumour cells and can, therefore, elicit truly tumour- specific T cell responses, thereby preventing ‘off- target’ damage to nonmalignant tissues. Second, neoantigens are de novo epitopes derived from somatic mutations, which presents the possibility to circumvent T cell central tolerance of self- epitopes and thus induce immune responses to tumours. Personalized neoantigen- based vaccines there- fore afford the opportunity to boost tumour- specific immune responses and add an additional tool to the immunotherapy toolbox. Furthermore, the potential of these vaccine- boosted neoantigen- specific T cell res ponses to persist and provide post- treatment immu- nological memory presents the possibility of long- term protection against disease recurrence. Limitations of this personalized approach to immunotherapy include the high costs and time delays associated with the\\n\\nvolume 18 | April 2021 | 215\\n\\nKey points\\n\\npersonalized therapeutic cancer vaccines predicated on neoantigens have been shown to be feasible, safe and immunogenic in patients with melanoma and glioblastoma.\\n\\nDifferent vaccine formats and delivery strategies are currently being tested in clinical studies involving patients with various tumour types.\\n\\nDeeper evaluation of the phenotypes, functionality and long- lasting memory potential of vaccine- induced neoantigen- specific CD4+ and CD8+\\tT cells\\tis\\twarranted\\t to improve understanding of their therapeutic activity and optimize vaccination strategies.\\n\\nNeoantigen target discovery is continually being advanced to improve the identification of immunogenic neoepitopes that can be recognized by CD8+\\tT cells;\\t algorithms for the more challenging task of predicting CD4+\\tT cell\\tneoepitopes\\tare\\t also emerging.\\n\\ninnovative vaccine delivery platforms and the most effective timing of combinatorial therapies should be further explored to reduce costs and time delays and increase clinical efficacy.\\n\\nmanufacture of individualized vaccines, uncertainty over the optimal neoantigen discovery platform and lack of consensus regarding the most suitable vaccine delivery platform.\\n\\nIn this Review, we discuss advances in the devel- opment of personalized neoantigen- based vaccines, current understanding of the T cell phenotypes and the immune responses elicited by these agents, and the clinical development landscape of this class of cancer therapy. We also consider avenues for improvement and future investigation.\\n\\nNeoantigens and antitumour immunity Neoantigens are targets of effective tumour- specific immune responses. Neoantigens can arise through a vari- ety of mutational events, with the numbers and types of mutation varying by cancer type2,3. These events include point mutations, insertions or deletions (indels)4 and gene fusions5. In tumours driven by viruses, viral pro- teins can be considered an alternative class of neoanti- gen, owing to their foreign nature6. Tumours with a high mutational burden are likely to have several candidate neoantigens for vaccine formulation. Fewer neoantigens are likely to be present in tumours with a low mutational burden, which might restrict the number of immuno- genic epitopes7; however, the induction of neoantigen- specific immune responses using immunotherapy8 or therapeutic vaccination9,10 remains a possibility within this category of tumours.\\n\\nNeoantigens can be recognized by tumour- infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells11,12, and increased immune cell infiltration and the related cytotoxicity signatures have been observed in tumours with a higher neoan- tigen load13–15. Accordingly, neoantigen presentation and load have been positively correlated with progno- sis in patients with a variety of cancers6,14,16,17 and with benefit from immune- checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with melanoma18,19, non- small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC)20,21 or colorectal cancer with mismatch- repair deficiency22. Together, these studies highlight the poten- tial therapeutic benefit of developing immunotherapies that specifically ‘train’ the immune system to target neoantigens.\\n\\nAs reviewed previously23–25, tumour mutational burden alone is an imperfect predictor of response to immunotherapy: additional factors determine whether a given mutation has the ability to induce an effective antitumour immune response, including the type of mutation (for example, clonal versus subclonal and single- nucleotide variant versus frameshift), to what extent the mutation is expressed, the ability of the encoded neoepitope to be presented by tumour cells and/or antigen- presenting cells (APCs), trafficking of T cells into the tumour and the immunosuppressive mechanisms active in the tumour or periphery of the host. Thus, even when targetable alterations are present, their existence alone might not be sufficient for effec- tive immunotherapy — other immunological param- eters are key determinants of efficacy. For example, in patients with prostate cancer, tumour mutational burden was not associated with response following treatment with the anti- CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab; however, a response to immunotherapy with this ICI was asso- ciated with a higher abundance of tumour- infiltrating CD8+ T cells and IFNγ- response gene signatures in pre- treatment tumours8. In addition, neoantigen- specific CD8+ T cells could be detected after therapy in blood from two of eight evaluated patients with favoura- ble responses to therapy, whereas neoantigen- specific responses were not observed in four evaluated patients with unfavourable responses8. Moreover, CD8+ T cell responses and myeloid signatures have been associated with progression- free survival (PFS) in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treated with the anti- PD- L1 antibody atezolizumab plus the anti- VEGFA antibody bevacizumab26. In patients with resectable pancre- atic cancer, neoantigen load alone was not correlated with overall survival (OS); however, correlations with OS were found when neoantigen load was combined with the abundance or diversity of tumour- infiltrating CD8+ T cells, or when neoantigen quality was consid- ered; these correlations were independent of adjuvant chemotherapy6. Whether a mutation is clonal or sub- clonal might also influence response to immunotherapy; in patients with microsatellite- stable solid tumours, clonal mutations were found to be associated with a response to ICI therapy, whereas a greater abundance of subclonal mutations was more likely to result in pro- gressive disease27. Furthermore, in this study, eight clonal neoantigens identified in driver genes (KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA) were associated with response across more than one patient27. Notably, tumour mutational bur- den might correlate with OS but not with response to anti- PD-1 antibodies28. Taken together, these findings indicate that, although neoantigens are promising tar- gets for immune- based therapies, consideration of addi- tional factors that can affect neoantigen- specific T cell responses and antitumour activity following therapeutic vaccination is crucial.\\n\\nNeoantigens and immunoediting. The importance of neoantigens in antitumour immunity is reflected by evidence of immunoediting. Immunoediting consti- tutes a dynamic process whereby tumour cells express- ing immunogenic neoepitopes are recognized and\\n\\n216 | April 2021 | volume 18\\n\\neliminated by T cells, leading to a tumour phenotype with reduced recognition by the immune system and, ultimately, to tumour outgrowth29. Reduced expression of neoantigens has been detected in metastatic tumours arising in a patient with progression of pancreatic cancer following primary tumour resection6. Moreover, immunotherapy can shape the repertoire of neoanti- gens expressed by a variety of tumour types, including melanoma30, NSCLC31,32 and glioblastoma33, suggesting ongoing immunoediting.\\n\\nAlthough these algorithms enabled the development of the first neoantigen- based vaccines, they are contin- uously being optimized by incorporating endogenous peptide processing and presentation rules to enable more precise prediction of neoepitopes with the high- est likelihood of being presented on the cell surface via MHC I proteins. Epitope prediction based solely on binding affinity data inherently does not provide infor- mation about which endogenously processed peptides will be presented by MHC I proteins on the surface of tumour cells and/or APCs and will induce effective CD8+ T cell responses.\\n\\nNeoantigens and tumour heterogeneity. Tumours have a high degree of genetic heterogeneity, which has fun- damental implications for the efficacy of cancer ther- apy, including immunotherapy34. The ability to identify tumour- specific mutations in individual patients is a key component of directing T cell responses to elimi- nate tumours through vaccination, thus warranting a personalized approach for therapeutic vaccine design. Tumour heterogeneity can also result in variable expres- sion of neoantigens between or even within tumours present in an individual patient; therefore, elimination of tumour cells expressing a specific neoantigen can result in outgrowth of tumour cells not expressing that neoantigen34. Consequently, it will probably be necessary to target multiple neoantigens using a single vaccine to reduce the likelihood of immune evasion and effectively eradicate the disease in its entirety30.\\n\\nIdentifying immunogenic neoantigens Neoantigen prediction in silico. The computational algorithm- based pipelines for neoantigen discovery and prioritization used in studies of therapeutic cancer vaccines to date have had several general commonali- ties9,10,35–37. Details of these workflows have been exten- sively reviewed25,38–41. As such, we only briefly outline the neoantigen prediction process here, with a focus on advances made over the past few years.\\n\\nTo identify tumour- specific somatic mutations, tumour biopsy specimens and nonmalignant tissue samples (usually peripheral blood mononuclear cells) are acquired from the patient in order to perform whole- exome sequencing for the comparison of tumour and germline DNA. Additional RNA sequencing provides information on the expression of the mutated genes and further confirmation of the mutation calls. A high num- ber of tumour- specific mutations can often be identified, depending on the tumour type; however, not all muta- tions result in neoepitopes that are recognized by the immune system, owing to HLA restriction. More than 16,000 different alleles of the classical HLA class I genes (HLA- A, HLA- B and HLA- C) are known to exist;42 there- fore, HLA typing is required to enable the prediction of potentially immunogenic epitopes.\\n\\nMHC I- binding epitopes are predicted using com- putational approaches, and peptides with a predicted HLA- binding affinity in the moderate- to- strong range (IC50 < 150 nmol/l) are considered more likely to induce CD8+ T cell responses43. Various computational approaches for predicting MHC I- presented epitopes have been developed44, and historically these algorithms have been trained on peptide binding affinity data.\\n\\nThe use of mass spectrometry (MS) has enabled the development of improved prediction algorithms trained on peptides eluted from MHC proteins45. In particular, algorithms trained using peptides presented by specific mono- allelic HLA- expressing cell lines better incorpo- rate endogenous antigen processing and presentation processes46,47. These MS- based algorithms can be further optimized by increasing the number of HLA alleles on which they are trained48. However, further studies are needed to improve understanding of the factors that can affect neo- antigen expression, presentation and immunogenicity. For example, data suggest that incorporating information on the position of a mutated residue within the peptide- binding groove could improve neoantigen discovery49.\\n\\nTo date, epitope- prediction methods have largely focused on MHC I- binding epitopes; MHC II- binding epitope prediction is much less advanced. The MHC I peptide- binding groove has closed ends that define the positioning of peptide epitopes 8–11 amino acids long for presentation to CD8+ T cells. By contrast, the MHC II peptide- binding groove has open ends, which confers the ability to bind and present peptides of longer and more variable lengths; the peptide regions flanking the portion bound to the core of the MHC II molecule can influence the binding of the peptide, and in addition these peptides can bind to multiple different MHC II molecules50. Together, these features of MHC II peptide binding complicate the identification of immunogenic MHC II epitopes. MHC II epitopes have, however, been incorporated indirectly into vaccine peptide design. Long peptides (15–30- mers) that encompass predicted MHC I- binding CD8+ T cell epitopes are used in vacci- nation strategies to promote uptake and processing of the peptides by professional APCs and thereby enhance T cell stimulation51,52. In addition to the presentation of predicted CD8+ T cell epitopes on MHC I proteins, this long- peptide approach is compatible with the pro- cessing and presentation of CD4+ T cell epitopes bound to MHC II proteins. Indeed, the preferential induction of CD4+ T cell responses compared with CD8+ T cell responses has been observed following vaccination in several clinical trials7,9,10,35,36,53. This observation might at least partially reflect the potential for pres- entation of a greater variety of peptides in the open- ended MHC II peptide- binding groove than in the more stringent MHC I peptide- binding groove54. Other immuno logical factors might also contribute to the dominance of vaccine- mediated CD4+ T cell response, such as differences in the stimulation of dendritic cell (DC) subsets that promote CD4+ T cell activation or,\\n\\nvolume 18 | April 2021 | 217\\n\\nvia cross- presentation of antigen, the induction of CD8+ T cell responses55.\\n\\nWith the exception of one study36, specific MHC II- binding neoepitopes have not been incorporated into the neoantigen vaccines investigated in clinical trials to date. However, efforts have been made to develop better tools for the prediction of such epitopes, recognizing that CD4+ T cells can orchestrate antitumour immunity and, via their classical ‘helper’ functions, have a crucial role in generating and sustaining CD8+ T cell responses. A stride forward in HLA- II prediction was made in 2019 with the creation of a mono- allelic HLA expression sys- tem for profiling of the HLA ligandome, referred to as ‘mono- allelic purification with tagged allele constructs’ (MAPTAC)56. This system provided the ability to iden- tify peptide- binding motifs of individual HLA alleles via MS, including >40 HLA class II alleles, which in turn enabled the training of a new machine learning- based prediction algorithm, neonmhc2, to identify MHC II- presented epitopes56. In another study published in 2019 (REF.57), a similar MS- based approach combined with motif deconvolution and annotation was used to train a machine learning prediction algorithm, MixMHC2pred. Moreover, the MHC II- binding epitope- prediction algo- rithm NetMHCIIpan, which was initially developed using peptide binding affinity data from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), was updated in 2020 to include the NNAlign_MA algorithm trained using MS- derived data on peptides eluted from MHC II proteins58. These efforts underscore a current focus on enhancing the induction of tumour- specific CD4+ T cell responses to improve the effectiveness of therapeutic cancer vaccines. Although prediction algorithms are undergoing continual improvement, as stated earlier, additional factors can affect the ultimate immunogenicity of the predicted epitopes. These include the overall patterns of gene expression, RNA splicing, proteosomal pro- cessing and, crucially, peptide loading and presenta- tion by MHCs25,40. Additionally, neoantigen sequences with similarity to pathogen- derived epitopes can exhibit enhanced immunogenicity probably because they can be better distinguished from self- epitopes by T cells6. Obtaining a better understanding of these factors will be important in optimizing the immuno- genicity of neoantigen- based therapies, and incorpo- rating such variables into computational algorithms will enable the design of more effective therapeutic T cell vaccines.\\n\\nAdministration of tumour lysate- pulsed DCs to patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, either alone or in combination with bevacizumab with or with- out low- dose cyclophosphamide, was found to induce de novo neoantigen- specific CD8+ T cell responses and enhanced some neoantigen- specific responses that were detected prior to therapy60. Patients with ex vivo evidence of T cell responses to autologous tumour cells or DC- presented tumour antigens following therapy had improved PFS relative to those without such evidence of antitumour responses. Moreover, 2- year OS was 100% in those with antitumour T cell responses compared with 25% in non- responders. Addition of the vaccine to ther- apy also seemed to improve OS when compared with bevacizumab and low- dose cyclophosphamide combi- nation therapy (2- year OS 78% versus 44% in a matched historical control group; P = 0.046). Low- dose cyclophos- phamide significantly improved OS when given along- side bevacizumab and the vaccine (P = 0.012)60. These findings suggest that tumour- lysate- based vaccine ther- apies can induce antitumour T cell responses, includ- ing neoantigen- specific CD8+ T cell responses. Thus, the use of tumour- lysate- based approaches and/or antigen delivery via APCs merits further exploration. Additionally, tumour- lysate- based vaccines could poten- tially be used as priming vaccinations while a person- alized neoantigen- based vaccine is being designed and manufactured59.\\n\\nMonitoring of neoantigen vaccine- induced immune responses. Following vaccination, assessment of T cell responses to epitopes included in the vaccines can be accomplished in vitro using a variety of tools. One approach to validating T cell specificity involves the trans- fection of genetic constructs encoding multiple patient- specific mutated epitopes, termed tandem minigenes, into APCs, followed by co- culture of the APCs with T cells isolated from the blood or tumour of the patient. Any APC subpopulations that induce T cell responses can then be further investigated to identify immunogenic epitopes61. Neoantigen- specific T cells have been detected using this technology in several different cancers61–64, including following therapeutic vaccination10,35, and this technology has also enabled the identification of neoantigen- specific T cell receptors (TCRs)62.\\n\\nAn alternative approach to inducing neoantigen- specific immune responses, beyond computational approaches, involves the use of tumour lysates59. Autol- ogous APCs, typically DCs, can be isolated from the patient and exposed to tumour lysates ex vivo, before being injected back into the patient with the aim of stimu- lating an immune response to TAAs or neoantigens. This method circumvents the sequencing and computational analysis required for the identification of patient- specific neoantigens59. As mentioned earlier, however, TAAs are less likely to be immunogenic and, in addition, might reduce the ability of relevant neoepitopes to stimulate immune responses owing to the higher abundance of nonimmunogenic self- antigens.\\n\\nNeoantigen vaccine- induced responses Immunogenicity and immunological profiling analyses conducted in clinical trials of personalized neoantigen- based vaccines have provided insight into the magni- tude, phenotype and functionality of vaccine- induced T cells (TablE 1). The first such trial used an autolo- gous DC- based vaccination strategy37, whereby three patients with stage III cutaneous melanoma previ- ously treated with ipilimumab were vaccinated with HLA- A*02:01- specific peptides encoding patient- specific tumour neoepitopes and three peptides from the melanoma- associated antigen gp100. Vaccination induced CD8+ T cell responses and a diverse TCR repertoire37; thus, this study was the first to reveal that therapeutic vaccination with neoantigens can increase both the diversity and breadth of T cell responses.\\n\\n218 | April 2021 | volume 18\\n\\nTable 1 | Key clinical trials of personalized neoantigen- based vaccines\\n\\nTrial\\n\\nPhase Tumour type\\n\\nVaccine format\\n\\nKey contributions\\n\\nRef.\\n\\nNCT00683670\\n\\nI\\n\\nAdvanced- stage melanoma\\n\\nDendritic cell Provided proof of concept that\\n\\nneoantigen vaccines can induce T cell responses\\n\\n37\\n\\nNeoVax (NCT01970358)\\n\\nI/Ib\\n\\nResected high- risk stage III/IV melanoma\\n\\nPeptide\\n\\nDemonstrated that neoantigen peptide- based vaccines can induce CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses and can be combined with ICIs\\n\\n35\\n\\nIVAC MUTANOME (NCT02035956)\\n\\nI\\n\\nNY- ESO-1- positive and/or tyrosinase- positive stage III or IV melanoma\\n\\nmRNA\\n\\nDemonstrated that mRNA vaccines incorporating TAAs and neoantigens can induce CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses and can be combined with ICIs\\n\\n36\\n\\nNeoVax (NCT02287428)\\n\\nI/Ib\\n\\nMGMT promoter- unmethylated glioblastoma\\n\\nPeptide\\n\\nDemonstrated that neoantigen vaccines can induce CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses in immunologically cold tumours with low mutational burdens\\n\\n10\\n\\nGAPVAC (NCT02149225)\\n\\nI\\n\\nGlioblastoma\\n\\nPeptide\\n\\nDemonstrated that peptide vaccines incorporating TAAs and neoantigens can induce CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses in immunologically cold tumours with low mutational burdens\\n\\n9\\n\\nICI, immune- checkpoint inhibitor; TAA, tumour- associated antigen.\\n\\nA subset of neoantigen- responsive T cells were detect- able prior to vaccination37, indicating that existing neoantigen- specific T cell responses were boosted, in addition to induction of de novo responses.\\n\\nIn another phase I trial evaluating personalized neoantigen- based vaccination, a peptide- based vac- cine (NeoVax) was administered to four patients with previously high- risk stage III and two with stage IV melanoma following initial curative- intent surgery35. The NeoVax vaccines comprised up to 20 different long peptides (15–30- mers), formulated with the adjuvant poly- ICLC (a TLR3 agonist consisting of carboxy- methylcellulose, polyinosinic–polycytidylic acid and poly- l- lysine double- stranded RNA). Previously unde- tectable neoantigen- specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were induced post- vaccination, with a greater fraction of the response consisting of CD4+ T cells35. These T cell popu- lations were polyfunctional, and neoantigen- specific CD4+ T cell transcriptional profiles post- vaccination revealed T helper 1 (TH1), effector and memory pro- grammes35. The four patients with stage III disease remained disease- free at a median follow- up duration of 25 months (range 20–32 months) after vaccination. The two patients with stage IV disease had disease recur- rence within a few months after the last vaccination and subsequently received pembrolizumab (an anti- PD-1 antibody), which resulted in complete regression of metastatic tumours in both patients and broadening of antitumour T cell responses35. This observation high- lights the potential of combination therapies to improve vaccine- induced T cell responses.\\n\\nIn a third phase I study36, a vaccine platform con- sisting of mRNAs encoding shared melanoma antigens (NY- ESO-1 and/or tyrosinase) and personalized neoan- tigen peptides was tested in 13 patients with stage III or IV melanoma. Profiling of T cells post- vaccination revealed that neoantigen- specific cytokine- producing CD8+ T cells\\n\\npresent in blood comprised central memory (TCM) and effector memory (TEM) populations36. Similar to the responses observed with NeoVax35, CD4+ T cell responses were greater in magnitude than CD8+ T cell responses36. Neoantigen- specific tumour- infiltrating lymphocytes were found in resected tumours from two patients. Together, these findings from studies in patients with melanoma provided proof of concept that personalized neoantigen- based vaccines can induce tumour- specific T cell responses in a therapeutic setting.\\n\\nMore recently, neoantigen- based vaccines have been studied in patients with glioblastoma, a cancer type that typically has a low mutational burden3,65 and that is generally considered to constitute an immuno- logically ‘cold’ tumour. In a phase I/Ib trial involving ten patients with MGMT promoter- unmethylated glio- blastoma, personalized long- peptide- based vaccines formulated with poly- ICLC (NeoVax) were admin- istered following standard- of- care surgical resection and radiotherapy10. Six of the eight vaccinated patients also received dexamethasone for the treatment of brain oedema, which impeded vaccine immunogenicity10. In the two vaccinated patients who did not receive dex- amethasone, however, neoantigen- specific CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses were detected in the periph- eral blood, and increased numbers of T cells were observed in intracranial tumours post- vaccination10. Transcriptomic analysis of tumour- associated T cells from one patient revealed varying degrees of expression of inhibitory receptors (including TIM3, LAG3, TIGIT and CTLA4), in addition to cytotoxicity signatures in both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells10. TCR reconstruc- tion revealed four neoantigen- specific CD4+ T cell and two neoantigen- specific CD8+ T cell clonotypes that were present in the post- treatment intracranial tumour. In the phase I GAPVAC-101 trial9, patients with glio- blastoma similarly received peptide- based vaccination\\n\\nvolume 18 | April 2021 | 219\\n\\n(with GM- CSF and poly- ICLC as adjuvants) follow- ing surgical resection and chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide, in parallel with temozolomide main- tenance therapy. The vaccination regimen consisted of two parts, the first component (APVAC1) involving vaccination with up to seven MHC I- binding peptides and MHC II- binding peptides derived from unmutated glioblastoma- associated antigens, and the second com- ponent (APVAC2) involving patient- specific neoantigens (typically two)9. The unmutated glioblastoma- associated antigens included in APVAC1 induced CD8+ T cell responses across multiple cell subsets, including those with a central memory phenotype9. Neoantigens in APVAC2 induced predominantly CD4+ T cell res ponses that were multifunctional and TH1 polarized9. CD4+ T cells specific for glioblastoma- associated anti- gen incorporated in the APVAC1 vaccine were found in resected tumour tissue obtained after recurrence from one patient, which suggests that vaccine- induced T cells have the ability to traffic into tumour tissue.\\n\\nNo clear signals of clinical benefit that could be attrib- uted to the vaccines were seen in either of the studies involving patients with glioblastoma. Nevertheless, evidence from both studies provides proof of con- cept that neoantigen- based vaccines can generate tumour- infiltrating T cell responses in immuno logically cold tumours with a low mutational burden, which supports further investigations aiming to optimize neoantigen- based therapeutic vaccines for such tumours. Altogether, these initial studies provided impor- tant knowledge of the immunogenicity and therapeu- tic potential of neoantigen- based personalized cancer vaccines. However, the extent of the induction and persistence of long- lived neoantigen- specific memory T cells in long- term survivors remains to be determined. Deeper phenotypic and functional analysis of these memory T cell populations could provide insights into the importance of subsets of memory T cells induced post- vaccination, particularly their potential to eliminate residual tumour cells.\\n\\nOptimally inducing antitumour responses Vaccine- induced immune responses have been exten- sively studied in the context of preventive vaccines for infectious disease, in order to understand the immuno- logical mechanisms of vaccination and their implica- tions for vaccine- mediated protection against infectious organisms. In the context of cancer, the stimulation of tumour- specific immune responses faces unique challenges that can limit the efficacy of therapeutic vaccines.\\n\\nVaccine development and optimization strategies typically involve testing the suitability of different delivery platforms, adjuvants, routes of administration, prime–boost strategies and incorporated antigens, all of which can affect the nature of the induced immune responses (as previously reviewed38). A key factor in the choice of a therapeutic cancer vaccine platform relates to how rapidly the vaccine can be designed, manufactured, administered and elicit antitumour T cell responses. Candidate vaccine platforms include peptides66, RNA67, DNA68, DCs69 and viral vectors70. Indeed, multiple\\n\\nplatforms hold promise for use in the development of personalized cancer vaccines and can be built upon for improvements.\\n\\nPriming of T cell responses. The immunological cascade elicited following vaccination commences rapidly with the induction of innate immune responses and uptake of antigens by APCs, which leads to priming of T cell responses in the draining lymph nodes56. Antigen- specific T cell responses then undergo an expansion phase, followed after antigen clearance by a contrac- tion phase that culminates in the generation of small populations of long- lived memory T cells71 (Fig. 1).\\n\\nPriming immunization can be crucial given that the phenotypes and magnitudes of initial T cell responses elicited can determine the subsequent ‘boostability’ of vaccine- elicited memory T cell populations72. This con- sideration is relevant because boosting immunizations will probably be needed to ensure adequate induction of neoantigen- specific T cell responses. Indeed, repet- itive antigen stimulation has the potential to continu- ally affect the gene- expression and functional profiles of memory CD8+ T cells72–74. Similar to preventive vaccines75, the timing of the administration of priming and boosting immunizations with therapeutic vaccines should be considered carefully, as should the timing of any combination therapies, given that these factors can all affect the resulting T cell phenotypes. Additionally, different adjunctive treatments might be needed for var- ious tumour types to account for their distinct immune microenvironments.\\n\\nThe quality and magnitude of CD8+ T cell responses can be influenced by numerous factors71,76,77, resulting in variable memory T cell populations with dis tinct anatomical distributions and functional capabili- ties78. In the context of cancer, induction of effective neoantigen- specific T cell responses can be compro- mised by peripheral tolerance mechanisms, a result of either regulatory T (Treg) cell- mediated suppression79 or tolerogenic T cell priming by DCs80. Theoretically, memory T cells induced through therapeutic vaccina- tion should persist in the long term following tumour clearance and might, therefore, contribute to protec- tion against future tumour recurrence (Fig. 1). Thus, the memory T cell populations that develop after therapeu- tic vaccination need to be investigated in preclinical models and, ideally, in patients with cancer78,81.\\n\\nMultiple memory T cell subsets exist, including TCM, TEM, resident memory T (TRM) and peripheral memory T (TPM) populations. TCM cells are most associated with local- ization to secondary lymphoid tissues, albeit with some degree of circulation in the blood81. TCM cells have a vast proliferative capacity, which enables them to mount vig- orous recall responses77. TEM cells mostly circulate in the blood and periphery, and can, therefore, rapidly respond to antigenic challenges82. TEM cells have a greater capacity for cytotoxicity and cytokine production than TCM cells, but have a lesser proliferative capacity than other memory T cell populations77.\\n\\nTRM cells localize within tissues to provide rapid responses upon antigen detection, including the release of cytokines and activation of other immune cell\\n\\n220 | April 2021 | volume 18\\n\\nBoosting of existing T cell responses\\n\\nPeak\\n\\nPatrol for recurrence?\\n\\nTCM cells\\n\\nd e c u d n i - e n i c c a V\\n\\ne s n o p s e r\\n\\nl l\\n\\ne c T\\n\\nInduced responses via epitope spreading\\n\\nDe novo induction\\n\\nContraction\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nTEM cells\\n\\nTRM cells\\n\\nr u o m u T\\n\\nn e d r u b\\n\\nTime post-vaccination\\n\\nTPM cells\\n\\nFig. 1 | Personalized neoantigen-based vaccination has the potential to induce long-lasting tumour-specific memory T cell populations. Following vaccination, both neoantigen- specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells are induced either de novo or through boosting of existing neoantigen- specific T cell responses. These T cells proliferate and kill tumour cells expressing the neoantigen. As tumour cells are eliminated, the release of tumour antigens might contribute to epitope spreading and thus an increased breadth of the tumour- specific T cell response. Following tumour eradication, the responding T cell populations contract, although subpopulations persist as components of the memory T cell pool. Indeed, vaccine- induced neoantigen- specific T cells have the potential to generate long- lived central memory T (TCM) cells and effector memory T (TEM) cells. Whether neoantigen- based vaccination can generate tissue- resident memory T (TRM) cells or peripheral memory T (TPM) cells remains unknown.\\n\\npopu lations83–87, and could potentially contribute to the immunological response following vaccination87,88. High numbers of intratumoural TRM cells are correlated with favourable OS in patients with lung cancer89,90 or head and neck cancer91. Moreover, a high abundance of tumour- resident TRM cells expressing TIM3 and PD-1 has been associated with a response to anti- PD-1 therapy in patients with lung cancer92. In a mouse model of head and neck cancer, TRM cells induced by preventive vaccination with a DC- targeted human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16)- derived E7 peptide con- tributed to tumour control, together with other mem- ory T cell populations89. TRM cells patrol a wide variety of organs85,93; therefore, inducing neoantigen- specific TRM cells through therapeutic vaccination might provide long- term immunosurveillance and protection against disease recurrence94.\\n\\nTPM cells are a more- recently described subset of CD8+ T cells and have been observed to participate in immunosurveillance of peripheral tissues in viral infec- tion models82. TPM cells can traffic through peripheral tissues, have self- renewal capacity and can differentiate into the highly proliferative TCM cells82, which underscores the potential benefits of harnessing this cell population in vaccination strategies. Although a better under- standing of this novel T cell subset is needed, the immuno surveillance function of TPM cells might prove particularly useful in preventing metastatic tumour recurrences.\\n\\npatients with cancer to date induce both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells expressing several inhibitory recep- tors9,10,35,36, suggesting that functional blockade of these receptors will be necessary to produce effective neoantigen- specific T cell responses. This hypothesis is supported by data from the trial of the melanoma vaccine NeoVax, in which two patients who had recur- rent tumours had complete tumour regression follow- ing treatment with pembrolizumab35. Findings from a number of studies demonstrate that TCF1- expressing ‘progenitor exhausted’ CD8+ T cells are capable of self- renewal or differentiation into terminally exhausted effector T cells and are important for the efficacy of ICIs103–106 and therapeutic vaccines106.\\n\\nThe importance of CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells have crucial roles in supporting the development of CD8+ T cell responses through licensing of DCs that prime CD8+ T cells, in addition to the provision of cytokines such as IL-2 (REF.107) This ‘help’ provided by CD4+ T cells is important for devel- oping antitumour CD8+ T cell responses108–112, including in the context of immune- checkpoint inhibition111. CD4+ T cells also produce cytokines that mediate the recruit- ment and activa tion of immune cell populations109,111,113–116 (Fig. 2). Furthermore, IFNγ produced by CD4+ T cells can indirectly result in the elimination of tumour cells117. Alter- natively, immunosuppressive CD4+ Treg cells can dampen immune responses and are often found within the tumour microenvironment (TME)79.\\n\\nCircumventing CD8+ T cell exhaustion. T cell exhaus- tion is one of the major challenges in antitumour immunity95. CD8+ T cell exhaustion is a gradual pro- cess96,97, which eventually leads to an irreversible dys- functional programme owing to epigenetic changes98–102. The personalized neoantigen- based vaccines tested in\\n\\nCD4+ T cells are also important in inducing sys- temic immune responses, which are required for effec- tive tumour control following immunotherapy in various mouse models118. Notably, neoantigen- specific CD4+ T cells have been found in tumour tissue from immunotherapy- naive patients with melanoma119.

Given the variety of crucial immunological roles of CD4+ T cells and their potential to shape vaccine- elicited immune responses, understanding the antitumour functions of this cell population (Fig. 2) and how they could be harnessed for neoantigen vaccines will be important122,123.\\n\\nAn early example suggesting a potential role of CD4+ T cells in therapeutic vaccination is provided by a study of a DC- based vaccine involving patients with stage III or IV melanoma, wherein inclusion of MHC II epitopes for TAAs in the vaccine resulted in increased induction of both TAA- specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells (in skin and/or blood) in some patients124. In mouse models of therapeutic cancer vaccines, the induction of tumour- specifc CD4+ T cells resulted in CD8+ T cells with improved effector functions111,125, a memory phenotype111, reduced expression of inhibitory markers (such as PD-1) and enhanced migration to and infiltra- tion of tumours, resulting in improved tumour control125. Indeed, the inclusion of MHC II neoantigens in vaccines contributed substantially to tumour eradication in multi- ple mouse models, with evidence of TME reshaping and CD8+ T cell epitope spreading observed53. These findings indicate the importance of eliciting CD4+ T cell responses using therapeutic vaccination to optimize CD8+ T cell responses and tumour control.\\n\\nIn addition to supporting CD8+ T cell responses, data from a mouse model of sarcoma have shown that expression of antigen that is MHC II restricted by\\n\\nElimination of MHC II+ tumours?\\n\\nGranzyme A\\n\\nCytotoxic gene expression signature\\n\\nGranzyme K\\n\\n‘Help’\\n\\nCD4+ T cell\\n\\nImmune cell recruitment\\n\\nTNF\\n\\nIFNγ\\n\\ntumours has been shown to be crucial for the efficacy of ICI therapy or a tumour vaccine even when the tumour cells themselves do not express MHC II111. This study similarly revealed that expression of an MHC II epitope and CD4+ T cell help was important for the induction of CD8+ T cell responses, and expression of an MHC II epitope by the tumour resulted in increased frequency of both intratumoural CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells111. Moreover, expression of MHC II antigens was asso- ciated with greater accumulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)- positive macrophages111. Thus, CD4+ T cell assistance in recruiting innate immune cells might have a role in vaccine efficacy. A potential role of recruited innate immunity is supported by findings of cell- depletion studies in a mouse model of therapeutic vaccination in combination with recombinant IL-2, an anti- PD-1 antibody and a TAA- targeting antibody126. Thus, the effects of vaccine- induced neoantigen- specific T cells on the landscape of innate immune cell popu- lations in tumours should be investigated in patients with cancer.\\n\\nSimilar to CD8+ T cells, the substantial diversity of CD4+ T cell subsets is well established127. Single- cell tran- scriptomic analyses of CD4+ T cells in a mouse model of colon adenocarcinoma and in human liver cancers demonstrated heterogeneity among the CD4+ T cells infiltrating tumours and tumour- draining lymph nodes, and a particular subset had a defined gene signature that was enriched in patients with intrinsic resistance to ICIs128. Furthermore, transcriptional profiling of neoantigen- vaccine- induced CD4+ T cells in patients with glioblastoma revealed cytotoxic signatures10. Most tumours are MHC II negative, although emerging evi- dence indicates that some tumours express MHC II129. Moreover, IFNγ produced by tumour- specific CD4+ T cells can stimulate upregulation of tumoural expres- sion of MHC II, which resulted in direct CD4+ T cell- mediated tumour elimination in a mouse model of melanoma130. Tumour- infiltrating cytotoxic CD4+ T cells have also been found in human bladder cancers and to have MHC II- dependent cytotoxic activity against the autologous tumour cells131. Whether cytotoxic CD4+ T cells induced by a therapeutic vaccine could mediate antitumour activity directly remains unclear and should be further investigated. This question is particularly important given that the neoantigen- based vaccines evaluated in the initial clinical studies induced a greater degree of CD4+ T cell response than CD8+ T cell response.\\n\\n↑ Antigen\\n\\ncross-presentation\\n\\nCytokine production\\n\\nFig. 2 | Roles of neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells following therapeutic vaccination. CD4+ T cells have many roles in the vaccine- induced antitumour immune response. By interacting with dendritic cells and enhancing antigen cross- presentation, CD4+ T cells perform the well- described roles of providing ‘help’ in the generation of the antitumour cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses. CD4+ T cells can also produce many cytokines, including IFNγ and TNF, that stimulate and modulate immune responses. In addition, other types of immune cell with potential antitumour activity, such as macrophages, can be recruited as a result of CD4+ T cell- related responses. Interestingly, cytotoxic gene- expression signatures have been observed in neoantigen- specific CD4+ T cells induced following therapeutic vaccination, which indicates that these cells might contribute to the elimination of tumours with upregulation of MHC class II (MHC II) proteins (dashed arrow); however, whether vaccine- induced neoantigen- specific CD4+ T cells do indeed have this capacity needs to be investigated further.\\n\\nAlthough antitumour CD4+ T cell responses have clearly been demonstrated, emerging evidence indi- cates that neoantigen- specific CD4+ Treg cells also exist. Tumour antigen- specific Treg cells have been observed in both peripheral blood and tumour specimens from patients with metastatic melanoma or gastrointes- tinal or ovarian cancers; the expansion of these spe- cific Treg cell clonotypes probably occurs in the TME, in a neoantigen- selective manner132. Neoantigen- specific Treg cells might have important implications for therapeutic vaccines. Theoretically, immunosuppressive Treg cells induced by vaccination could dampen other vaccine- induced antitumour immune responses.\\n\\n222 | April 2021 | volume 18\\n\\nChoice of vaccine platform\\n\\nTumour lysate-pulsed dendritic cells\\n\\nNeoantigen-pulsed dendritic cells\\n\\nDNA\\n\\nPeptides\\n\\nViral vectors\\n\\nRNA\\n\\nPrime dose\\n\\nRepeat sequencing of tumour DNA\\n\\nBooster dose\\n\\nAssessment of vaccine-induced T cell responses in blood and tumour\\n\\nTime to manufacture\\n\\nShorter\\n\\nLonger\\n\\nTumour biopsy Disease recurrence\\n\\nVaccine dosing regimen\\n\\nTimeline\\n\\nRoute?\\n\\nCombination therapies\\n\\nPre-vaccination Promote baseline immunity (e.g. FLT3L or GM-CSF)\\n\\nAt vaccination or post-vaccination Boost vaccine-induced immune responses (e.g. anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-CTLA4 or anti-CD40 antibodies)\\n\\nFig. 3 | Considerations relating to therapeutic neoantigen vaccine regimens. Various factors should be considered during the design of therapeutic vaccination regimens. Following sample collection, the time required to generate the personalized vaccine is a crucial factor, particularly in the metastatic disease setting. The manufacturing time is dependent on the choice of vaccine platform, as indicated for the various platforms listed along the red arrow. However, while the personalized vaccine is being designed and manufactured, combinatorial therapies can be administered to the patient with the aim of fostering a favourable immunological milieu. Adjunctive therapies can also be given either at the time of or following vaccination to enhance the immune response. Additional variables include the route of administration of the vaccine and any combination therapies, as well as the number of booster vaccinations. In the case of disease recurrence, tumour DNA sequencing can be repeated (for example, to understand why the vaccine was ineffective for long- term tumour control and/or to identify potential alternative neoantigens), and vaccine- induced T cell responses can be evaluated using both blood and tumour s a m p l es t o i nf orm d ec is ions r eg ar ding s ub se qu ent t he ra py. FLT3L, Fms- related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand; GM- CSF, granulocyte–macrophage colony- stimulating factor.\\n\\nIn line with potential inhibitory effects of vaccination, the ATLAS epitope- selection platform has been designed to account for ‘inhibitory’ neoantigens during vaccine formulation133. The exact mechanism of these inhibitory neoantigens has not been defined; however, using the ATLAS platform, immunostimulatory and inhibitory epitopes can be identified through high- throughput ex vivo screening assays involving autologous T cells and APCs134. Together, these observations highlight the need to obtain a better understanding of the CD4+ T cell phenotypes induced by therapeutic vaccination.\\n\\nDesigning effective vaccine- induced immune responses. The question of how to elicit specific beneficial T cell pheno- types is crucial to the development of effective therapeutic cancer vaccines. Data indicate the importance of sequenc- ing of combination therapies as well as roles for CD4+ T cells and novel CD8+ T cell subsets. Methodical testing of vaccination regimens will provide insights into how various vaccine strategies influence the magnitude and phenotype of neoantigen- specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Thus, detailed immuno phenotyping should be conducted to clearly define T cell phenotypes and responses. Together, this information could contribute to the development of improved neoantigen- based vaccination regimens.\\n\\nClinical neoantigen vaccine development As discussed previously, the initial clinical trials testing personalized neoantigen- based vaccines were conducted largely in disease settings in which all tumours had been\\n\\nsurgically removed and no additional standard therapy was indicated, enabling the administration of an inves- tigational vaccine alone. Given that ICIs targeting PD-1 or PD- L1 have broad clinical efficacy across cancers and that antitumour activity seems to depend on the presence of pre- existing T cell responses in the tumour (that is, an immunologically ‘hot’ TME), testing personalized vaccines in combination with PD-1 or PD- L1 inhibition is a logical next step in the clinical development of these therapies (Fig. 3). The observation of complete responses to PD-1 inhibitors in patients with melanoma who had dis- ease progression during or after therapeutic neoantigen- based vaccination35 has been interpreted as potentially indicative of synergy between ICIs and vaccination, although complete responses can sporadically occur with PD-1 inhibition alone in patients with metastatic mela- noma. In line with these considerations, ongoing clini- cal trials are combining personalized neoantigen- based vaccines with PD-1, PD- L1 and/or CTLA4 inhibitors in various tumour types (TablE 2).\\n\\nA personalized long- peptide vaccine formulated with poly- ICLC (NEO- PV-01) has been assessed in combination with nivolumab in the phase Ib NT-001 trial involving patients with advanced- stage mela- noma (n = 34), NSCLC (n = 27) or urothelial carcinoma (n = 21)135. Patients received nivolumab monother- apy while the vaccines were being manufactured, as well as during the vaccination and post- vaccination periods.

Vaccine- specific TCRs were detected in post- vaccination tumour samples from two patients with melanoma, one of whom had a radiographic response, and one who had stable disease following treatment135, indicating that the vaccines induced traf- ficking of neoantigen- specific T cells into metastatic tumours. Clinical benefit obser ved after vaccination could not be directly attributed to the vaccine owing to the use of nivolumab and the nonrandomized design of the study, although longitudinal assessments of biopsy samples revealed that major pathological responses occurred after vaccination in nine patients with melanoma who did not have such a response to initial pre- vaccination treatment with nivolumab, three of whom had a residual tumour burden of >80% prior to vaccination135. Moreover, evidence of epitope spreading of the T cell responses to neoantigens not contained in the vaccines (suggesting vaccine- mediated tumour cell killing) was observed. Notably, epitope spread- ing was associated with a lack of disease progression at 6 months after initiation of therapy in the urothe- lial carcinoma group and at 9 months in the NSCLC and melanoma groups (P = 0.03 across groups), trans- lating into improved PFS in the three groups overall (HR 0.23, 95% CI 0.06–0.83; P = 0.01)135. These find- ings suggest vaccine- mediated clinical benefit. The\\n\\ncombination of nivolumab and NEO- PV-01 was well tolerated, with mild injection- site reaction and transient flu- like symptoms observed in 52% and 35% of patients, respectively.\\n\\nGEN-009 is a personalized neoantigen- based vac- cine comprising 4–20 synthetic long peptides selected using the aforementioned ATLAS epitope- discovery platform and formulated with poly- ICLC. In an ongo- ing multicentre phase I/IIa study (NCT03633110), eight patients with solid tumours with a high risk of recurrence after completion of curative- intent treat- ment received GEN-009 and tolerated the vaccine well, with only local injection- site discomfort reported136. All patients were found to have peripheral CD4+ T cell and CD8+responses against at least one neoantigen, and 99% of all peptides stimulated T cell responses (74% induced CD8+ T cell responses and 92% induced CD4+ T cell responses)137. Of note, T cell responses were often sustained for more than 12 months136. Further data from this trial, which also includes a cohort of patients with advanced- stage disease who are receiving the vac- cine in combination with PD-1 inhibitors (TablE 2), are awaited.\\n\\nIn a phase Ib study137, a personalized RNA–lipoplex neoantigen- based vaccine encoding up to 20 neoan- tigens (RO7198457) was tested in combination with the anti- PD- L1 antibody atezolizumab in 132 patients\\n\\nvolume 18 | April 2021 | 225\\n\\nwith advanced- stage solid tumours (NCT03289962) (TablE 2). Circulating T cell responses to a median of 2.6 neoantigens were detected ex vivo in 77% of patients. Vaccine- specific CD8+ T cells were detected at frequencies >5% in the peripheral blood and had a TEM phenotype with high levels of PD-1 expression137. Vaccine- specific TCRs were also detected in post- vaccination but not in pre- vaccination tumour spec- imens. The antitumour activity of RO7198475 in combination with atezolizumab was modest, with two objective responses in 28 patients (7%) with var- ious advanced- stage solid tumours who were enrolled in the dose- escalation part of the study and objective response rates (ORRs) between 4% and 30% (8% overall) in the expansion cohorts, which comprised patients with triple- negative breast cancer, urothelial carci- noma, RCC, melanoma or NSCLC137. The ORRs were not higher than those expected with PD- L1 inhibition alone in these patient groups. Treatment- related adverse events were primarily systemic reactions (low- grade cytokine- release syndrome, infusion- related reactions or flu- like symptoms).\\n\\nmRNA-4157, another lipid- encapsulated RNA- based neoantigen- based vaccine, has been tested as mono therapy in 13 patients with high- risk resectable solid tumours and in combination with pembrolizumab in 20 patients with unresectable advanced- stage solid tumours, with the latter group including 12 patients who had disease progression on prior ICI therapy (NCT03313778)138 (TablE 2). No dose- limiting toxicities or grade 3–4 adverse events were observed138. Six clini cal responses were observed in the 20 patients (ORR 30%) treated with the combination, including two (17%) of the 12 patients who had previously received ICIs.\\n\\nDo personalized neoantigen- based vaccines medi- ate antitumour activity in patients with cancer? Preliminary signals of clinical activity have been obtained using personalized neoantigen- based vaccines in several proof- of- concept studies (conducted primar- ily in patients with resected melanoma who were at high risk of disease recurrence)35,36. However, initial clinical trials in patients with advanced- stage solid tumours treated with personalized vaccines in combination with ICI have not demonstrated ORRs that are clearly supe- rior to those achieved with ICI monotherapy135,137,138. In the NT-001 study135, the number of patients who con- verted from initial disease progression during the ICI monotherapy period to a response after vaccination with NEO- PV-01 was modest (13%). The possibility that combination therapy with personalized vaccines and ICI could prolong anti- PD-1- mediated responses remains; however, the personalized neoantigen vaccines used in the studies to date have been mostly ineffective in addressing the issue of primary resistance to PD-1 ICIs, at least when given after the initiation of and/or concurrently with PD-1 inhibition. Randomized tri- als will be necessary to provide conclusive evidence of improved anti tumour activity of PD-1 or PD- L1 ICIs in combination with personalized vaccines and are ongo- ing in the settings of first- line therapy for advanced- stage melanoma (NCT03815058) and adjuvant therapy\\n\\nfor high- risk NSCLC (NCT04267237) or melanoma (NCT03897881) (TablE 2).\\n\\nHow can clinical efficacy be improved? Despite the apparently modest levels of clinical benefit shown to date, correlative analyses of data from the initial trials of neoantigen- based vaccines provided evidence of robust immunogenicity and on- target tumour cell killing. Neoepitope- specific responses of both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were seen in all vacci- nated patients in the phase Ib studies of peptide plus poly- ICLC vaccine NEO- PV-01 and the RNA–lipoplex vaccine RO7198457 (REFS135,137). Furthermore, traffick- ing of vaccine- induced neoantigen- specific T cells to metastatic tumours was observed in both studies135,137. In the trial of NEO- PV-01, epitope spreading and post-vaccination pathological responses correlated with prolonged PFS135. Nevertheless, T cell responses were not consistently detected in ex vivo assays, and a relatively large proportion of the vaccine neoepitopes did not stimulate T cell responses135,137. Furthermore, although large numbers of T cells targeting certain neoepitopes were detected, many vaccine neoepitopes induced only low- frequency responses135,137. As we have described, one challenge in the field of cancer vaccine research relates to improving our under standing of how to induce maximum activation and expansion of T cell responses and of CD8+ T cells in particular. To accomplish this aim, complementary therapies that promote APC function and optimal priming of T cells in the lymph nodes will probably be necessary (Fig. 3). Therapeutic agents with the potential to achieve this include ICIs, agonists of co- stimulatory receptors (such as CD40), TLR agonists and growth factors supporting DC development and/or function (such as granulocyte– macrophage colony- stimulating factor (GM- CSF) and Fms- related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L). We are conducting phase I trials in patients with completely resected advanced-stage RCC (NCT02950766) or unresectable melanoma (NCT03929029), in which personalized neoantigen- based vaccines are being coadministered with ipilimumab, an ICI targeting CTLA4 (TablE 2). In preclinical models of lymphoma, in situ vaccination approaches consisting of intu- moural injections of FLT3L and poly-ICLC plus local radiotherapy led to the recruitment of cross-priming DCs and improved the efficacy of PD-1 inhibition139. The in situ vaccination strategy alone induced objec- tive responses, including some abscopal responses, in patients with treatment- resistant non- Hodgkin lymphomas; furthermore, non- responders had incre ases in the abundance of phenotypically exhausted, PD-1+CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood following treat- ment, supporting the combination of this approach with PD-1 inhibition139.\\n\\nAnother challenge relates to the identification of a vaccine delivery system that enables rapid, cost- effective manufacturing and thus timely deployment of the vaccines (Fig. 3). As reviewed previously140, different vaccine formats — comprising peptides, RNA, DNA, viral constructs or DCs — each have advantages and disadvantages; however, head- to- head comparisons of\\n\\n226 | April 2021 | volume 18\\n\\nTumour biopsy\\n\\nNon-malignant tissue (peripheral blood)\\n\\ns C F S f o r e b m u N\\n\\nELISpot\\n\\nWeeks after vaccination\\n\\nSomatic mutation identiﬁcation and HLA typing\\n\\nIdentiﬁcation of immunogenic epitopes\\n\\n+\\n\\nConﬁrm expression of mutated genes\\n\\nWild type\\n\\nMutated epitope\\n\\nControl\\n\\nT cells\\n\\nscRNA-seq\\n\\nPopulation 1 Population 2 Population 3 Population 4 Population 5\\n\\nTarget discovery\\n\\nVaccine formulation and administration\\n\\nImmune assessment\\n\\nAreas for advancement\\n\\nNon-SNV mutation calling pipelines\\n\\nIn silico MHC II epitope prediction algorithms incorporating MS\\n\\nNeoepitope validation\\n\\nVaccine platforms (peptide, RNA, dendritic cell, DNA or viral vectors)\\n\\nInclusion of predicted MHC II epitopes\\n\\nSequencing and dosing schedules\\n\\nDelineate vaccine-induced immune responses • Assess phenotypes of CD4 + and CD8+ T cells • High-resolution immunophenotyping via scRNA-seq and scTCR analysis\\n\\nIdentify correlates of improved tumour control\\n\\nIdentify correlates of improved tumour control\\n\\nFig. 4 | Algorithm-based identification of neoantigens for use in therapeutic vaccines. Many areas of advancement might improve the efficacy of personalized vaccines, as indicated in this figure. For example, the identification of targetable neoantigens could be improved through development of better prediction algorithms. Various vaccine modalities and dosing schedules could be explored to generate maximally effective antitumour immune responses. Importantly, detailed assessments of the characteristics of the immune responses induced by vaccination could be used to inform iterative improvements in the approach to vaccine design and administration. These include evaluating the magnitude of neoantigen- specific responses (by ELISpot) and in- depth phenotyping via single- cell RNA sequencing (scRNA- seq) analyses. MHC II, MHC class II; MS, mass spectrometry; scTCR, single- cell T cell receptor; SFC, spot- forming cell; SNV, single- nucleotide variant.\\n\\nthese different approaches in patients are lacking. This situation most probably reflects the current reality of the clinical drug development landscape, in which vaccine formats are typically chosen based on the available tech- nology, in- house experience and intellectual property, among other criteria. Conceivably, cooperative groups could perform such comparative studies, although sys- tematic comparisons of different personalized vaccine platforms are unlikely to be undertaken in the near term given the current high costs and complexity of this therapeutic approach.\\n\\nThe timing of ICI administration and therapeu- tic vaccination is another important consideration (Fig. 3). This point was highlighted in a preclinical study in which concurrent administration of a PD-1 inhibitor and a therapeutic cancer vaccine improved both vaccine- induced immune responses and tumour control in a mouse model141. Conversely, PD-1 inhi- bition before vaccination resulted in a population of PD-1+CD38hiCD8+ T cells that were dysfunctional in the same model, a finding that was attributed to a sub- optimal priming environment for induction of CD8+ T cell responses141. Indeed, this PD-1+CD38hiCD8+ T cell population was shown to contribute to immunotherapy failure in mice, and patients with intrinsic resistance to PD-1 ICIs were found to have higher numbers of these dysfunctional T cells in blood and tumour samples than responders141. Thus, combining ICIs with therapeutic vaccination regimens can be beneficial, but will require\\n\\ncareful consideration of the most appropriate sequencing of the component therapies.\\n\\nConclusions The ability to rapidly and comprehensively identify tumour- specific mutations has provided the cancer vaccine field with long- elusive tumour- specific targets. Initial studies have shown that personalized neoantigen- based vaccines can be generated and administered safely to individual patients with cancer. In- depth profiling of vaccine- induced T cell responses, includ- ing the use of newly available immunogenomic tools, has demonstrated that all vaccinated patients develop T cell responses to subsets of the immunizing epitopes and that vaccine- induced T cells can traffic into meta- static tumours. Neoantigen- prediction algorithms have largely focused on MHC I epitopes, but a predominance of CD4+ T cell responses has been observed. Despite emerging evidence of crucial roles of CD4+ T cells, developing strategies that induce maximal cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses remains important, in addition to the robust neoantigen- specific CD4+ T cell responses elicited in the initial trials to date (Fig. 4). Numerous studies utilizing a spectrum of different vaccine delivery platforms and combination therapies are underway, with the ultimate goal of stimulating effective, long- lasting, tumour- specific immunity in patients with cancer.\\n\\nPublished online 20 January 2021\\n\\nvolume 18 | April 2021 | 227\\n\\n1.

Recently, therapeutic cancer vaccines have shown promise by eliciting de novo T cell responses targeting tumor antigens, including tumor-associated antigens and tumor- speciﬁc antigens. The objective was to amplify and diversify the intrinsic repertoire of tumor-speciﬁc T cells. However, the complete realization of these capabilities remains an ongoing pursuit. Therefore, we provide an overview of the current landscape of cancer vaccines in this review. The range of antigen selection, antigen delivery systems development the strategic nuances underlying effective antigen presentation have pioneered cancer vaccine design. Furthermore, this review addresses the current status of clinical trials and discusses their strategies, focusing on tumor-speciﬁc immunogenicity and anti-tumor efﬁcacy assessment. However, current clinical attempts toward developing cancer vaccines have not yielded breakthrough clinical outcomes due to signiﬁcant challenges, including tumor immune microenvironment suppression, optimal candidate identiﬁcation, immune response evaluation, and vaccine manufacturing acceleration. Therefore, the ﬁeld is poised to overcome hurdles and improve patient outcomes in the future by acknowledging these clinical complexities and persistently striving to surmount inherent constraints.\\n\\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\\n\\n(2023) 8:450\\n\\n; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-023-01674-3\\n\\nINTRODUCTION Overcoming malignant tumors, which are the primary cause of mortality, is crucial to increase global life expectancy. A staggering estimate of 19.3 million novel cancer cases and an unfortunate toll of approximately 10 million cancer-related mortalities were witnessed in 2020, highlighting the urgency of this challenge.1 Conventional cancer therapies, interventions, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, are substantially toxic and exhibit restricted applicability, thereby underscoring the urgency for developing more efﬁcacious cancer treatment modalities.2 Current relevant studies suggest that cancer progressing is highly associated with “cancer immunoediting”. This dynamic interplay indicates that the immune system is able to eradicate nascent cancer cells by recognizing mutated oncogenic genes or foster an immunosuppressive microenvironment conducive to tumor pro- liferation.3 Therefore, the fate of cancer cells is determined by a delicate balance within the immune system.\\n\\nincluding surgical\\n\\nthe primary purpose of averting infectious diseases. Nevertheless, their capacity to enhance antigen-speciﬁc immune reactions has gained recognition as a promising therapeutic instrument for combating cancer.8 Although vaccines can incorporate predeﬁned or unknown antigens, this study focused on predeﬁned cancer vaccines, including shared antigens or personalized neoantigens. After immunization, the cancer antigen is absorbed by the antigen presentation cells (APCs), where tumor-related antigens are processed into major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I/II complexes. Subsequently, the activated APCs undergo migration into the draining lymph nodes, where MHC I/II complexes bind to T cells, causing their priming and activation. The activated T cells travel towards the tumor site, inﬁltrating the tumor tissue under favorable co-stimulatory conditions and guided by chemokine gradients. Once within the tumor microenvironment, these activated T cells can control tumor growth through direct tumor cell destruction and cytokine-mediated processes (Fig. 1).9'),\n",

An illustrative instance is autologous dendritic cell vaccine, sipuleucel-T, which prolonged survival of 2–4 months in patients with metastatic resistant prostate cancer. This therapeutic intervention targets prostate acid phosphatase, a TAA that exhibits high expression levels in prostate cancer cells.20,21 Additionally, a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine comprising four TAAs has demonstrated the capacity to elicit robust and durable immune responses directed against these antigens, with or without in patients with unresectable melanoma.22 A lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based cancer vaccine encoding the four most frequent Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS) mutation antigens (G12D, G12V, G13D, and G12C) is able to elicit both cytotoxic and memory T cell phenotypes targeting KRAS- mutated tumor cells.

Five elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia were treated with WT1 recombinant protein in a phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT01051063) and the majority of the patients achieved above- average response durations.24 MAGE family proteins are the most widely used immunogenic cancer-testis antigens with hetero- geneous expression in tumor cells and poor understanding.16,25 A large-scale MAGE-A3 immunotherapy-focused phase 3 trial as an adjuvant therapy was conducted, however, the vaccine didn’t improve the clinical beneﬁts of the patients with resected stage III melanoma, leading to its discontinuation.26 In a phase 3 trial, the MAGE-A3 protein vaccine was terminated because of its limited immunogenicity in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).27 Notably, it may be due to cross-reactivity with many MAGE-A isoforms. Therefore, a MAGE-A DNA vaccine consensus sequence was formulated to address this issue, which elicited a robust immune response, signiﬁcantly leading to a substantial reduction in tumor growth in mice.28 Mucin 1 glycoprotein is widely distributed and abnormally glycosylated on cancer cells’ surfaces. Tecemotide, a peptide vaccine used against mucin 1, extended the overall survival in patients with advanced NCSLC who were concurrently undergoing chemoradiother- apy.29,30 Additionally, high expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu (HER2/neu) makes some breast cancers highly malignant.31 The peptide vaccine Nelipepimut-S was safe in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer; however, no therapeu- tic effect was observed when compared to the placebo group.32 Nevertheless, the use of Nelipepimut-S plus trastuzumab resulted in speciﬁc and durable immune responses in patients with triple- negative breast cancer and resulted in a signiﬁcant clinical beneﬁt to the patients.33 A plasmid DNA vaccination encoding the HER2/ neu intracellular domain was shown in a recent phase 1 clinical study to induce the production of antigen-speciﬁc type 1 T cells in a majority of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.15\\n\\nICI,\\n\\npatients\\n\\nwith\\n\\nadvanced tumor 1 (WT1)\\n\\nKRAS-mutated\\n\\n(OS)\\n\\ntargeting shared Viral antigen.

These processes are essential to prepare the peptide for presentation on the MHC molecule. The natural processing and presentation of antigens constitute an intricate process, necessitating precise peptide processing to enable its effective presentation on the MHC molecule. Thus, even if a peptide is predicted to exhibit a strong binding afﬁnity to MHC, it may not trigger a T cell response due to upstream peptide processing factors. These factors encompass how the protein is cleaved, trimmed, loaded onto the MHC molecule, and transported to the cell surface, which prevents the actual loading of the peptide.69 Owing to constraints posed by the immune proteasome, not all k-mer peptides can be naturally generated in vivo, and only a fraction of these peptides can be translocated to the appropriate cellular compartments to interact with MHC molecules.70 As a result, several computational tools have been developed with a speciﬁc focus on immune proteasomal processing and peptide cleavage. A pivotal step preceding the peptide-MHC interaction is proteolysis, the break- down of proteins into peptides facilitated by the immune proteasome.71 Methods like ProteaSMM and NetChop 20 S were most effective in capturing in vitro proteasome digestion patterns for MHC class I antigens. Conversely, NetChop Cterm trained on MHC-I ligand data demonstrated superior predictive capabilities for in vivo whole-cell proteolysis.71 Moreover, TAP proteins play a role in translocating peptide fragments from the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby facilitating the process of loading these peptides onto MHC molecules.

Cyto- solic receptors can recognize double-stranded DNA structures, allowing plasmid DNA vaccines to simultaneously activate innate immunity.100 However, many limitations still exit in the DNA vaccine clinical application. DNA must conquer both extracellular and intracellular barriers to migrate into the cell nucleus, posing a challenge for DNA-based antigen delivery system. Physical methods are the most common administration strategies, includ- ing electroporation, gene gun and sonoporation, which lead to the difﬁculties in clinical promotion.101–103 DNA vaccines have demonstrated limited immunogenicity in clinical trials, despite their effective delivery. Efforts have been made to enhance the efﬁcacy of DNA vaccines through various strategies. These include advancements in the design of DNA vaccine vectors, the incorporation of cytokine adjuvants, and the exploration of innovative non-mechanical delivery methods.104'),\n",

Protamine is a polycationic natural peptide with a positive charge that can bind to mRNA to form complexes and maintain mRNA stability.112 The self-adjuvanted mRNA CV9103 coated with protamine, encoding several prostate cancer-speciﬁc TAAs, was safe in patients with prostate cancer, although no clinical beneﬁt was observed in phase 1/2 clinical studies.113\\n\\nenergies while guaranteeing the\\n\\nRNA vaccine The emergency use of two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines brought mRNA vaccines back into the spotlight. The MIT Technology Review released a compilation of the top 10 breakthrough technologies for 2021, with mRNA vaccines ranking ﬁrst due to their dramatic changes in revolutionizing the medical ﬁeld.105 Compared to the risk of integration into the host genome in DNA vaccines, mRNA is produced using in vitro transcription and can be directly translated into protein once they enter the cytoplasm, offering a well-tolerated delivery method without the risk of genome integration.106 The mRNA is also transiently expressed in cells, enabling repeated inoculations.107 Furthermore, mRNA- encoded units are ﬂexible and versatile, making it feasible to encode tumor antigens and immunomodulatory molecules. This ﬂexibility is valuable for inducing both adaptive and innate immunity effectively.\\n\\nTechnical barriers to mRNA vaccines are centered on their molecular design and in vivo delivery efﬁciency. mRNA modiﬁca- tion and the sequence design of the its regulatory and coding regions play a crucial role in determining mRNA stability and translation efﬁciency. The antigen translation efﬁciency can be enhanced using codons preferred by somatic cells to limit the GC content of mRNA sequences and calculating and selecting mRNA\\n\\nSeveral studies have been carried out to access the anti-tumor efﬁcacy of LNP-formulated mRNA neoantigen cancer vaccines. Neoantigens and driver gene mutations were tandemly linked into a single mRNA sequence, coated with LNP, and administered to patients with gastrointestinal cancer. The cancer vaccine could elicit a robust and broad neoantigen-speciﬁc immune response. TCRs targeting KRAS G12D have been isolated and identiﬁed from patients’ blood after tumor vaccine application.114 The latest clinical trial of mRNA-4157 in high-risk melanoma showed that the combination with mRNA-4157 and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) greatly prolonged the distant-metastasis free survival and reduced the risk of developing distant metastases or death by 65% compared to pembrolizumab alone. Owing to these exciting clinical ﬁndings, mRNA-4157 is poised to become the world’s ﬁrst mRNA personalized tumor vaccine to undergo phase 3 clinical study.98 Notably, after the ﬁrst patient was dosed with a vaccine using non-nucleoside modiﬁed RNA for personalized cancer therapies in 2012, BioNTech developed a new class of tailored mRNA therapeutics using multiple mRNA versatile, formats with distinct properties capable of addressing several cancers.

Vaccines contain- ing 8–12 amino acids derived from tumor antigens include MHC-I- binding short peptides preferably endocytosed, processed, and presented by professional APCs to elicit peptide-speciﬁc T cells.118 Synthetic long peptide (SLP) vaccines typically contain 25–35 amino acids, frequently encompassing multiple epitopes or larger portions of the target protein.119 Therefore, SLP vaccines contain- ing multiple epitopes can elicit broader and more diverse immune responses using longer peptide sequences. This broader response may enhance vaccine effectiveness by targeting a wider range of antigens or strains.120 Utilizing SLPs rather than short peptides can further enhance peptide stability and antigen delivery efﬁciency (Fig. 5).121 However, SLP cancer vaccines have disadvantages such as complex preparation, potential for HLA-restriction, and rapid degradation.

Boosting innate immunity through TLR7 or TLR8 are effective antiviral strategy.126 In a study of patients with resected locally advanced melanoma, the SLP vaccine LPV7 containing seven TAA peptides in combination with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA) and agonists for TLR3 (poly-ICLC) and TLR7/8 (resiquimod) induced TAA-speciﬁc T cells, but did not enhance the immune response rate compared to the vaccine alone, indicating that immunogenicity may be enhanced by poly- ICLC plus IFA.127 Although a few clinical studies have investigated different tactics, a good ORR has not been achieved in patients with cancer. Additionally, SLP vaccines may be restricted to individuals with speciﬁc HLA types, limiting their universal applicability.128 Expanding the range of HLA-restricted SLP vaccines or developing strategies to overcome HLA restrictions could increase the number of individuals who will beneﬁt from this cancer vaccine type.\\n\\nNotably, the SLP vaccine research is evolving continuously, and ongoing studies and technological advancements may further improve their design, formulation, and applications.\\n\\nCell-based vaccine Cell-based cancer vaccine is a cancer vaccine that utilizes patient’s own immune cells. DCs are harnessed to both antigens soluble and particulate exogenous states in diverse formats, encompass- ing DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides, or tumor lysates. To augment the antigenicity of vaccines, various carriers such as emulsions, liposomes, and polymeric particulate carriers are employed.129 This uptake is facilitated through techniques like electroporation transduction.130–134 Besides conventional APCs’ or function, isolated DCs are antigen donor cells, transferring to endogenous cross-presenting APCs with multiple layers of co- stimulation and can secrete key cytokines.135 The ﬁrst individual DC cancer vaccine was administrated in 6 patients diagnosed with melanoma. By immunized with a personalized neoantigen pulsed autologous DC vaccine in patients with metastatic lung cancer, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) responded strongly to predicted neoantigens, thus expanding the diversity of alternative therapies for lung cancer.136 In a recent phase 3 clinical trial, an lysate-loaded DC vaccine (DCVax-L) was autologous\\n\\nlentiviral\\n\\ntumor\\n\\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\\n\\n(2023) 8:450\\n\\nincorporated into the standard treatment regimen for both newly diagnosed glioblastoma (nGBM) and recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM).

Recombinant viruses can serve as vectors to inﬁltrate immune cells and deliver substantial quantities of tumor antigens, which consequently trigger the activation of T cells and instigate the initiation of anti-tumor immune responses.157,158 While preclinical studies have shown promise, clinical trials utilizing viral vectors as standalone cancer vaccines have, for the most part, yielded disappointing results.158 Nevertheless, clinical outcomes can be improved when they are combined with other therapies. A phase 2 study showed that T-VEC, an engineered oncolytic herpes simplex 1 virus encoding GM-CSF, combined with standard neoadjuvant therapy in patients with triple negative breast cancer, achieved complete pathologic response in 45.9% of the patients, 89% remained disease-free 2 years post-treatment, and most patients had higher levels of anti-tumor T cells and immune signaling pathways activation.159 Similarly, TG4010, which is a recombinant modiﬁed cowpox virus encoding MUC1 and IL-2, in conjunction with chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC or PANVAC plus docetaxel for patients with metastatic breast cancer clearly offers additional clinical advantages for patients.160,161\\n\\nOver the past century, Busch and Fehleisen et al. ﬁrst reported a link between cancer and bacteria and found that Streptococcus pyogenes infection could lead to tumor regression.162 Currently, using bacteria as carriers to deliver tumor antigens has many advantages. Bacillus is highly active under prevailing anaerobic/ hypoxic conditions [mostly hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME)].163 Some auxotrophic strains, such as Salmonella, are attracted to the TME to absorb metabolic nutrients.164 Summarily, bacteria have several advantages as potential carriers for anti- cancer drugs or gene vaccine delivery. They thrive in a hypoxic TME, are attracted to the tumor for nutrient uptake, and migrate into remote areas of the tumor.

As of July 2023, 1847 clinical trials have been registered on the United States National Library of Medicine’s ClinicalTrials.gov website with the keyword “cancer vaccine”, of which 947 have been completed, and 224 are actively recruiting. Neoantigen-based cancer vaccine research accounts for the research. Table 2 presents the only a small portion of representative relevant clinical studies. Current ﬁndings indicate that the use of cancer vaccines alone does not yield effective outcomes in prolonged patient survival, although antigen-speciﬁc T cell immune responses have been detected in most clinical trials. Therefore, enhancing T cell activation and anti-tumor efﬁcacy is the most signiﬁcant therapeutic challenge.\\n\\nCOMBINED THERAPY Speciﬁc combined strategies have been devised to address diverse treatment challenges considering the distinctive patholo- gical characteristics of each tumor, different drug resistance mechanisms, and the advantages and disadvantages of distinct vaccine platforms. Patients with advanced cancer, particularly those with multiline therapy, frequently encounter a high tumor burden, multiple drug resistance, and immune deﬁciency. Achieving disease remission by simultaneously reducing the tumor load and enhancing the body’s anti-tumor immunity has been the primary aim in these patients (Fig. 6). Consequently, several combination strategies have been implemented to induce tumor remission by minimizing the tumor burden and boosting anti-tumor immunity. The initial step involves surgery, chemother- apy, or radiotherapy to reduce or eliminate the tumor cells. The subsequent stage focuses on establishing immunological memory to prevent tumor recurrence and stimulate speciﬁc immunity to eradicate any remaining tumor cells through vaccination. This comprehensive approach can improve clinical outcomes and reduce the risk of disease progression.'),\n",

Maximizing the immune response and antitumor efﬁcacy of vaccination requires careful evaluation of the optimal dosing, administration route, and frequency in preclinical and clinical trials.\\n\\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\\n\\n(2023) 8:450\\n\\nr a e y\\n\\nt r a t S\\n\\n3 2 0 2\\n\\n3 2 0 2\\n\\n2 2 0 2\\n\\n0 2 0 2\\n\\ns r o t a g i t s e v n\\n\\n&\\n\\np r a h S\\n\\nk c r e M\\n\\n,\\n\\nC L L\\n\\ne m h o D\\n\\n.\\n\\nc n\\n\\nI\\n\\nX T a n r e d o M\\n\\ny m e d a c A\\n\\ne s e n h C\\n\\ni\\n\\na c i d e M\\n\\nf o\\n\\ns e c n e i c S\\n\\na n r i\\n\\nm e t S\\n\\ns c i t u e p a r e h T\\n\\nE S\\n\\nh c e T N o B\\n\\ni\\n\\nt n e m\\n\\nl l\\n\\no r n E\\n\\n9 8 0 1\\n\\n0 4\\n\\n0 3\\n\\n1 0 2\\n\\nt n o p d n E\\n\\ni\\n\\ny r a m\\n\\ni r P\\n\\nS F R\\n\\nE A\\n\\nT L D\\n\\nT L D\\n\\nS F D\\n\\nn o i t a r t s i n m d A\\n\\ni\\n\\ne t u o r\\n\\nr a u c s u m a r t n\\n\\nl\\n\\nn o i t c e n\\n\\nj\\n\\nd e n o i t n e m\\n\\nt o N\\n\\ns u o e n a t u c b u S\\n\\nn o i t c e n\\n\\nj\\n\\ns u o n e v a r t n\\n\\nn o i t a n b m o C\\n\\ni\\n\\ny p a r e h t\\n\\nb a m u z i l\\n\\no r b m e P\\n\\nb a m u z i l\\n\\no r b m e P\\n\\nb a m u a v r u d\\n\\nl\\n\\nr o\\n\\n/\\n\\nb a m u z i l\\n\\no r b m e P\\n\\nn o i t a c i d n\\n\\nI\\n\\na m o n a e m k s i r - h g H\\n\\nl\\n\\ni\\n\\ng n u\\n\\nl\\n\\ne b a r u c n\\n\\nl\\n\\nI\\n\\nr e c n a c\\n\\nd\\n\\ni l\\n\\no s\\n\\ne p i t l u M\\n\\nl\\n\\ns r o m u t\\n\\nI I\\n\\ne g a t S\\n\\nd e t c e s e R\\n\\ns e n i c c a v\\n\\ne u d e h c s\\n\\nl\\n\\nd n a\\n\\ne s o D\\n\\n, s e s o d\\n\\n9 g μ 0 0 0 1\\n\\n,\\n\\nw 3 q\\n\\nd e w o\\n\\nl l\\n\\no f\\n\\ng n m\\n\\ni\\n\\ni r p\\n\\n4\\n\\ns r e t s o o b\\n\\n3\\n\\ny b\\n\\nw 3 q\\n\\ng μ 0 5 1 – 0 5\\n\\n2 1\\n\\no t\\n\\np u\\n\\nw 8 q\\n\\n,\\n\\nw q\\n\\nr e c n a c\\n\\nc i t u e p a r e h t\\n\\nt n a v u d A\\n\\nj\\n\\n/\\n\\n/\\n\\n/\\n\\n/\\n\\nf o\\n\\ns l a i r t\\n\\nl\\n\\na c i n\\n\\nm r o f t a P\\n\\nl\\n\\nP N L\\n\\ns u o g o o t u A\\n\\nl\\n\\nC D\\n\\nx e p y o p o p L\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\ni\\n\\nP N L\\n\\ni l c\\n\\ng n o g n o\\n\\ni\\n\\nd e t c e e S\\n\\nl\\n\\n. 2\\n\\ne l b a T\\n\\nn e g i t n a\\n\\nt e g r a T\\n\\nl\\n\\na i r t\\n\\na c i n\\n\\ni l\\n\\nC\\n\\ne n i c c a v\\n\\nr e c n a c\\n\\nA N R m\\n\\nn e g i t n a o e N\\n\\n7 7 5 3 3 9 5 0 T C N\\n\\nA N R m\\n\\n) 3\\n\\ne s a h p\\n\\n(\\n\\nn e g i t n a o e N\\n\\n9 3 4 6 8 8 5 0 T C N\\n\\nA N R m\\n\\n) a 2 / b 1\\n\\ne s a h p\\n\\n(\\n\\nn e g i t n a o e N\\n\\n2 5 7 8 9 1 5 0 T C N\\n\\nA N R m\\n\\n) 1\\n\\ne s a h p\\n\\n(\\n\\nn e g i t n a o e N\\n\\n8 7 3 6 8 4 4 0 T C N\\n\\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\\n\\nn o i t c e n\\n\\nj\\n\\nd n a\\n\\n) k s i R\\n\\nh g H\\n\\ni\\n\\n(\\n\\ns h t n o m\\n\\nA N R m\\n\\n) 2\\n\\ne s a h p\\n\\n(\\n\\n9 1 0 2\\n\\n8 1 0 2\\n\\nE S\\n\\nh c e T N o B\\n\\ni\\n\\nA N R\\n\\nh c e T N o B\\n\\ni\\n\\ns l a c i t u e c a m r a h P\\n\\n1 3 1\\n\\n5 1\\n\\nE A\\n\\n,\\n\\nS F P\\n\\nR R O\\n\\ns u o n e v a r t n\\n\\nn o i t c e n\\n\\nj\\n\\nr a u c s u m a r t n\\n\\nl\\n\\nn o i t c e n\\n\\nj\\n\\nb a m u z i l\\n\\no r b m e P\\n\\nl\\n\\na t c e r o o C\\n\\nl\\n\\nI I I\\n\\ne g a t S\\n\\nr e c n a C\\n\\nd e c n a v d A\\n\\na m o n a e m\\n\\nl\\n\\nd\\n\\ni l\\n\\no s\\n\\ne p i t l u M\\n\\nl\\n\\ns r o m u t\\n\\n2 1\\n\\no t\\n\\np u\\n\\nw 8 q\\n\\n,\\n\\nw q\\n\\ns h t n o m\\n\\n,\\n\\ng m 9 3 0 g m 3 1 0\\n\\n.\\n\\n,\\n\\n.\\n\\n,\\n\\n8 W\\n\\n4 W\\n\\n,\\n\\n2 W\\n\\n0 W\\n\\n/\\n\\n/\\n\\nP N L\\n\\nP N L'),\n",

Each delivery route has its set of challenges that inﬂuence the best delivery method to overcome (Table 2).180 For example, intradermal injection facilitates efﬁcient antigen delivery by the Langerhans cells and mesenchymal DCs in the epidermis and dermis, respectively.181 Skeletal muscle only contains a few immune cells; therefore, conventional vaccines frequently contain\\n\\nadjuvants that can arouse an inﬂammatory response at the injection site to recruit APCs to induce an anti-tumor response by injection.182 The intravenous administration of intramuscular cancer vaccines faces difﬁculties, such as rapid drug degradation and serum protein aggregation.183 The stability and uptake ratio of nucleic acid vaccine can be improved by carrier packaging. Biodistribution after intravenous administration is also crucial; for example, cationic LNP-mRNA vaccines primarily target the liver after into liver- targeted therapies.184 Different vaccination methods may result in varied antigen accumulation and immune responses at distinct sites in the body. For instance, vaccines with human serum albumin as an adjuvant showed stronger Th2 effects following oral primary immunization in mouse models compared to immuniza- tion via intramuscular or subcutaneous routes.185 A DNA vaccine encoding key rheumatoid arthritis autoantigens administered intramuscularly reduced the disease incidence and severity better than subcutaneously and intravenously, without local accumula- tion.186 Direct viruses, immunostimulant-carrying mRNAs, and activated autologous or allogeneic DCs to the tumor site can lead to immediate TME alterations without requiring antigen prediction.187,188 However,\\n\\nsystemic administration, providing insights\\n\\ninjecting\\n\\nadjuvants,\\n\\ntumor-lysing\\n\\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\\n\\n(2023) 8:450\\n\\nthis approach is suitable for only individuals with treatable conditions.189\\n\\nAdditionally, antigen expression and delivery can be limited by lymph node drainage.

By administering different vaccination schedules at a ﬁxed cumulative antigen dose, researchers can determine the most effective antigenic stimula- tion of CD8+ T cells. Research has shown that antigenic stimulation that increased exponentially over days stimulated antiviral immunity more effectively than a single or multiple doses with daily equal dosages.192 The administration timing, total dose, and prime and boost intervals were thoroughly studied to justify the initial clinical program.21 However, because of insufﬁcient large-scale clinical trials for cancer vaccines and the high degree of heterogeneity among patients with cancers, obtaining accurate and stable dose-response relationships remains challenging. Therefore, optimal experimental models should be explored to clarify the ideal dosage and delivery method for each cancer vaccine to provide the maximum clinical beneﬁt for patients.\\n\\nCLINICAL CHALLENGES Although an increase of anti-tumor effector cells have been detected after vaccination, only modest clinical beneﬁts have been achieved in small-scale populations. Which variables restrict cancer vaccine efﬁcacy? What difﬁculties do the existing clinical applications encounter? The following section will focus on the current clinical challenges associated with cancer vaccines.\\n\\nAnimal models and preclinical innovations It is a great challenge to study the interactions between immune cells and tumors as well as to assess the alterations in immune cell phenotype and function after anti-tumor therapies due to the intricacies of the human immune system and the complexity of the TME. While mouse models are invaluable for gaining fundamental insights into basic biological processes, they have limitations when it comes to investigating human tumor biology, the intricate TME, and the mechanisms underlying resistance to immunological therapy. These limitations underscore the impor- tance of combining insights from mouse models with clinical research to develop a comprehensive understanding of cancer and its treatment.193\\n\\nHumanized mice have begun to fulﬁll this gap by generating mice with Prkdcscid mutation, Rag1/Rag2 deﬁciency or disruption of the IL2rg locus disruption to reduce host innate and adaptive immunity.194 These severely immunodeﬁcient mice support the growth of cell line-derived xenografts (CDX) and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) after reconstruction of the human immune system. Several key aspects of humanized mice restrict their application in cancer vaccine research, including the under- development of mature humanized host immune cell populations (particularly T cells and plasmacytoid DCs for cancer vaccines), insufﬁcient HLA molecules in standard immune-deﬁcient mouse strains, and absence of well-developed lymph node structures and germinal centers, leading to an inability to generate antigen- speciﬁc cellular immunity.195 In addition, the accurate prediction of neoantigens relies on comparative calculations of tumor tissue and PBMC sequencing data from the same donor, which this dual humanized strategy depends on the availability of cancer patients\\n\\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\\n\\n(2023) 8:450\\n\\nTherapeutic cancer vaccines: advancements, challenges, and prospects Fan et al.'),\n",

Currently, commonly used mouse models for the immune system humanization include the human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (huPBMC) humanized mice model and the human hemato- poietic stem cell (huHSC) humanized mice model. huPBMC humanized mice model can rapidly reconstitute mature and activated human T-lymphocytes, but cannot successfully recon- stitute the myeloid system including DCs, or present antigens.194 The anti-tumor effect of carbonic anhydrase 9 antibody was tested using allogeneic huPBMC in NOD/SCID/IL2Rγ (-/-) mice by transplanting a novel orthotopic renal cell carcinoma CDX and found that the antibody of this tumor-speciﬁc antigen inhibited tumor growth.196 Transplanted human PBMC mediates acute graft-versus-host disease and body weight loss. In severe cases, death owing to graft-versus-host disease signiﬁcantly impacts drug efﬁcacy experiments by shortening the vaccination time window.197 The huHSC humanized mice model is able to rebuild various human immune cells, such as T, B, and myeloid cells, however, the incomplete development of mature human innate cell lineages, coupled with the HLA expression, imposes limita- tions on the use of huHSC models in cancer vaccine studies.198 In many studies, the introduction of transgenic expression of HLA molecules has led to improved development and survival of human T cells, making these models more suitable for investigat- ing cancer vaccines.199 An example of this strategy was the transduction of a lentiviral vector containing HLA-A*0201 and A*2402-restricted TCR speciﬁc for the WT1 antigen into CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells to express HLA-A24. With this approach, WT1-speciﬁc CD8+ T cells were detected in both thymus and these mice.200 Based on the precise peripheral sequencing of CDX or PDX, rapid construction of humanized mice using matched-HLA human PBMCs or hematopoietic stem cells allows for a more comprehensive immune system through strategies, such as thymus transplantation, which is still important for assessing the immunogenicity and tumor-suppressing efﬁ- ciency of future neoantigen cancer vaccines.\\n\\ntissues of'),\n",

Gene editing technologies can also optimize vaccine design and screen vaccine targets. For example, researchers found that tumor cells sensitive to interferon-β were transformed into drug-resistant tumor cells through by knocking out CRISPR-Cas9 technology, which subsequently caused them to release the immunomodulatory factors interferon-β and GM- CSF.201 These modiﬁed therapeutic tumor cells can effectively activate signaling pathways speciﬁc to antigen-triggered T cell activation and stimulate the trafﬁcking of immune cells, which may be beneﬁcial for the further application of cancer vaccines.201 Developing an appropriate in vitro assessment model to characterize the function of antigen-speciﬁc T cells is critical to therapeutic cancer vaccine research.

PD-L1-positive DCs suppress T cell function by presenting antigens to them, and cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts secrete extracellular matrix components that physically restrict T cell inﬁltration into the tumor.207 Figure 7 summarizes the roles of the different components in creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment.\\n\\nTumors often promote immunosuppressive cell subpopula- tion differentiation or activation to evade immune attacks. Targeting and eliminating these immunosuppressive cells can improve tumor vaccine efﬁcacy. For example, low continuous doses of cyclophosphamide selectively target and eliminate Tregs while promoting Th17 differentiation, thereby supporting host anti-tumor immunity.208,209 The stand of care chemother- apy with carboplatin/paclitaxel can deplete HPV-speciﬁc Treg and MDSCs, which may enhance the efﬁcacy of HPV16 SLP cancer vaccine.173 Recent approaches have exploited macro- phage plasticity by reprogramming M1 macrophages to an M2 anti-tumor phenotype, through targeting molecules, including PI3K, STAT3 and IDO-1.210–212 Developing immunotherapy- based combination therapies (e.g., CTLA4, PD-1/PD-L1) has emerged as a prominent trend in the ﬁeld of cancer vaccine application (discussed in the combined therapy section above). Antigen-speciﬁc T cells generated by cancer vaccines often express suppressor molecules, and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is involved in signaling mediated by the TCR recognition of antigens, providing a mechanism through which tumor cells can resist attacks by T cells.213,214 Therefore, blocking the PD-1/PD- L1 signaling pathway can release the immune system “brake”, reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment.

The low expression of these neoantigens contributes to poor T cell inﬁltration and ICI responses.222 Since insufﬁcient antigenic stimulation may cause early immune escape from cancer, therapeutic vaccination can be employed using therapeutic priming, including anti-CD40 and ICIs.222 With the breakthroughs in immunotherapy, particularly the success of ICIs in inﬂamed tumors, the scope of immunotherapy is expanding to encompass tumors. Even within immune-excluded and immune-desert tumors with low passenger mutation rates, advanced high- throughput techniques have enabled identifying immunogenic neoepitopes detectable by CD8+ T cells. For example, despite the low mutation rate in PDAC, pathogenic germline variants were identiﬁed using the MSK-IMPACT panel, and personalized mRNA cancer vaccines were established to induce individual immune response against neoantigens speciﬁc to this tumor.116,223 Research has demonstrated that cancer vaccines can activate cytotoxic T cells in non-inﬂammatory tumors displaying immune achieved through the exclusion or desert phenotypes,\\n\\nIn addition,\\n\\nthe higher\\n\\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\\n\\n(2023) 8:450\\n\\nTherapeutic cancer vaccines: advancements, challenges, and prospects Fan et al.\\n\\nintegration of integrates next-generation sequencing and mass spectroscopy data.'),\n",

Patients who have undergone one or several prior regimens may encounter challenges in responding to cancer vaccines because of severe damage to bone marrow function and immune system suppres- sion caused by multiple drug therapies.97,224 To address these issues and provide treatment access to more patients with advanced disease, there is a need to expand the use of cancer lines to ﬁrst-line treatment. vaccines from later Therefore, the risk of patients becoming severely ill to receive treatment can be reduced.175 However, cancer vaccine efﬁcacy in advanced diseases is limited because of disease progression and these patients’ poor physical condition. Another important consideration is the personalized cancer vaccine manufacturing time, which typically takes at least 2 months. This duration renders these vaccines unaffordable for patients with advanced stage cancer. One approach to tackle this challenge is to focus on early-stage diseases where patients have not yet established immune tolerance. Utilizing neoadjuvant therapy in patients with early-stage cancer and employing cancer vaccines in post- operative therapy may extend the therapeutic time window and maximize individual neoantigen cancer vaccine efﬁcacy under conditions of load and better physical scores. Therefore, cancer vaccine-related studies are more desirable in the disease or postoperative patients, the early stages of intraepithelial neoplasia and including HPV-related cervical high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.225,226 Recent advances in cancer vaccines have been promising. For instance, BioNTech reported preliminary clinical data from a phase 1 trial of an individual mRNA-based neoantigen-speciﬁc immunother- apy combined with atezolizumab and mFOLFIRINOX chemother- apy in patients with resected PDAC. This approach generated cytotoxic and durable neoantigen-speciﬁc T cells, potentially delaying recurrence in patients with PDCA.116 Similarly, Mod- erna/Merck’s personalized cancer vaccine mRNA-4157 in combi- for nation with pembrolizumab as an adjuvant patients with resected stage III/IV melanoma signiﬁcantly reduced the risk of recurrence and death, providing further evidence regarding the potential for the future commercializa- tion of personalized neoantigen cancer vaccines in postoperative patients.98\\n\\nCancer vaccines are under development\\n\\ntreatment\\n\\nlow tumor\\n\\ntreatment'),\n",

The success of these clinical trials hinges on the careful design of trial endpoints. As shown in Table 2, ensuring safety is paramount, necessitating diligent monitoring and evaluation of safety indicators, including adverse events and side effects, to safeguard the patient’s well-being. Designing clinical trials with a greater focus on the clinical beneﬁts to patients is crucial since prolonged patient survival is the most satisfactory and trustworthy outcome of a cancer vaccine efﬁcacy assessment. Although initial small-scale clinical trials have shown modest improvements in cancer vaccine efﬁcacy among patients with tumors, most lacked the rigor of a two-arm randomized controlled trial. Consequently, evaluating the clinical beneﬁts of cancer vaccines for patients with tumors is crucial through large- scale phase 3 randomized controlled clinical trials. These trials can adopt efﬁcacy indicators including PFS, OS, and RFS as the gold standard for evaluating vaccine efﬁcacy. A recent clinical trial design led by Merck and Moderna, involved a phase 3, randomized, double-blind study that evaluated the combination the efﬁcacy of of mRNA-4157 and pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab alone in 1089 patients with melanoma In this trial, RFS was the primary endpoint, (NCT05933577).\\n\\n17\\n\\n18\\n\\nTherapeutic cancer vaccines: advancements, challenges, and prospects Fan et al.\\n\\ninto the product’s efﬁcacy and\\n\\nproviding valuable insight validating its potential for melanoma treatment.\\n\\nThe fundamental objective of cancer vaccines is to activate the immune system against tumor cells. Several immune metrics are considered to evaluate the immunological efﬁcacy of cancer vaccine, and assessing antigen immunogenicity after vaccination has become the important endpoints in clinical trials. Interferon-γ Enzyme-Linked Immuno-Spot (ELISpot) could identify T cell clones respond to the speciﬁc antigen epitopes, while ﬂow that cytometry analysis of peptide-MHC conjugates (e.g., tetramer) enables detecting the number of neoantigen-speciﬁc T cells in PBMCs.97,116 Researchers have previously used intracellular to determine activation status and cytokine staining (ICS) cytotoxicity of T cells after in vitro stimulation with matched epitopes or tumor- inﬁltrating lymphocytes and peripheral blood T cells can be informative, particularly regarding T cell phenotypes and antigen- speciﬁc interactions. Bulk TCR sequencing is a valuable tool that offers insight the TCR repertoire.228 Therefore, this technique provides an overall view of T cell populations that respond to tumor neoantigen vaccines when many T cells are analyzed together. Additionally, single-cell TCR sequencing analysis is a more focused approach that provides a precise and detailed characterization of individual T cell responses.229 Another study identiﬁed antigen-speciﬁc clonal expansion by TCR sequencing of T cells cultured for a short period after peptide stimulation and combined it with a bioinformatics platform (MANAFEST).230 This cutting-edge method reveals dynamic changes at in cancer neoantigen vaccine-speciﬁc T cells. This demonstrates the high speciﬁcity and efﬁcacy of T cell immune responses triggered by tumor neoantigen vaccines at the cellular level. Moreover, studies follow-up after neoantigen vaccination in have shown that patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and monitoring of individualized neoantigen mutations in peripheral blood circulat- ing tumor DNA could facilitate real-time evaluation of the clinical response.228 Longitudinal analysis of blood samples can also provide relevant information on changes in the immune system dynamics over time.\\n\\nlysates.67,227 TCR sequencing of\\n\\ntumor'),\n",

Additionally, a re-biopsy tissue post-vaccine treatment can be analysis of conducted to provide evidence of vaccine effectiveness. The efﬁcacy assessment of the major pathological responses can be performed by analyzing the residual tumor content of the tissue core biopsies pre-and post-treatment. The inﬁltration of CD3+ T cells at the tumor site post-treatment was associated with a good clinical response.97 In the future, novel technologies, such as multiplex immunoﬂuorescence, slide-DNA-seq, and TARGET-seq, will enable a more reﬁned characterization of tissue changes following vaccination. These advancements will provide dynamic and precise predictions of disease outcomes and immunotherapy responses.\\n\\nthe tumor\\n\\ntumor\\n\\nBy combining comprehensive clinical and immunological assessments, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the effects of cancer vaccines on patient outcomes and immune system activation. This data-driven approach not only paves the way for potential regulatory approvals but also opens doors to advancements in cancer treatment. Furthermore, with solid evidence from well-designed clinical trials, cancer vaccines have the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment and improve patient outcomes, providing new hope for the ﬁghting cancer.\\n\\nAccelerate vaccine manufacturing Cancer vaccine technologies are still in the early stages of formats have been explored in development, and various preclinical and clinical studies for off-the-shelf and personalized cancer vaccines. Optimal delivery conditions, including the choice of adjuvant and schedule of administration, should be established for all forms of personalized neoantigen vaccines. The vaccine design will signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the strength of the immune response to candidate neoantigens.\\n\\nThe manufacture of cancer vaccines is a signiﬁcant challenge. Shared antigen cancer vaccines can be mass-produced as ready-to- use, reducing production times and costs. Since each personalized neoantigen vaccine is treated as a stand-alone drug, demanding for rapid drug production, scalability, and cost control is needed to enable rapid clinical application. This differs from the conventional pharmaceutical development approach, focusing on bulk upscaling. Therefore, adopting a synthetic vaccine technology that facilitates robust, fast and cost-effective production through a simple, invariant, and good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant process is essential to address these complexities. Favorable solutions may involve completely digitizing the production pro- cesses, platforming the production quality control, modularizing production plants, and intelligentizing production hardware.231 There is a need for better coordination of every aspect of production and preparation, automated management tracking of every step, and acceleration of the entire vaccine preparation. These advance- ments have enabled the creation of scaled parallelized miniaturized production lines and signiﬁcantly enhanced the overall efﬁciency and accessibility of cancer vaccines for clinical applications.'),\n",

Immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive cell therapies have demon- strated tumor regression-inducing ability inpatient with hemato- logical and solid tumor cohorts. These advances have showcased the viability of immunotherapy, and cancer vaccine development has entered a phase of rapid growth by mimicking natural immunity. Therapeutic cancer vaccines represent an innovative trajectory for future immunotherapy, primarily because of their safety proﬁle, speciﬁcity, and ability to confer enduring immune memory. Cancer vaccine research is undergoing an intense surge in early-stage clinical investigations globally. Predeﬁned antigen cancer vaccines targeting TAA have been investigated in prior research, although their efﬁcacy is limited. Personalized cancer vaccines targeting neoantigens have gar- nered signiﬁcant interest. However, their widespread application remains constrained by challenges, such as the intricacy of neoantigen identiﬁcation, complexities of rapid manufacturing, and intricacies of detecting clinically meaningful immune responses. Less-successful clinical trials have gained valuable insights, guiding the necessary adjustments and modiﬁcations to enhance their performance. These endeavors underscore the dynamic nature of research and the iterative process required to propel cancer vaccines toward their full therapeutic potential.\\n\\ntumor\\n\\nFuture advancement of the clinical efﬁcacy of therapeutic cancer vaccines is concentrated in several key areas, including identifying immunogenic neoantigens, optimizing vectors and delivery plat- forms, and surmounting the immunosuppressive TME. Next- generation sequencing, increased computing power, and advanced algorithms have signiﬁcantly enabled identifying highly immuno- genic neoantigens. Ongoing research is dedicated to reﬁning vaccine technologies, including exploring diverse expression formats, improving co-stimulation components, and identifying suitable prime-boost approaches. Optimally selecting a delivery system is crucial to amplify antigen immunogenicity and facilitate the entry of\\n\\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\\n\\n(2023) 8:450\\n\\nthe antigen and an activation signal into APCs. Strategically incorporating immune checkpoint inhibitors and other treatment regimens is another avenue for exploration. These combined approaches can counteract the immunosuppressive milieu of the TME and mitigate immunotherapy resistance development. How- ever, the precise composition of combination therapies, and their sequence and dosage, require further investigation and reﬁnement. Establishing a tumor-speciﬁc cytotoxic T cell response remains a pivotal challenge in cancer immunotherapy. The overarching objective of these multifaceted strategies involves selecting a treatment regimen that stimulates effective, durable, and tumor- speciﬁc immunity in patients with cancer and prolongs their survival through cancer vaccines. The convergence of innovative approaches, strategic candidate selection, and reﬁned adminis- tration protocols hold the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment, paving the way for a new era of therapeutic cancer vaccines. We will witness the successful emergence of numerous therapeutic cancer vaccines with ongoing advancements.\\n\\nDATA AVAILABILITY All relevant data are within the manuscript and its additional ﬁles.\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China 81573008 and 81860547 (Chunyan Dong) and National Natural Science Foundation of China 82203861 (Wanlu Cao).

Ott1,2,3,4\\u2009✉\\n\\nAbstract | Within the past decade, the field of immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of many cancers with the development and regulatory approval of various immune- checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapies in diverse indications. Another promising approach to cancer immunotherapy involves the use of personalized vaccines designed to trigger de novo T cell responses against neoantigens, which are highly specific to tumours of individual patients, in order to amplify and broaden the endogenous repertoire of tumour- specific T cells. Results from initial clinical studies of personalized neoantigen- based vaccines, enabled by the availability of rapid and cost- effective sequencing and bioinformatics technologies, have demonstrated robust tumour- specific immunogenicity and preliminary evidence of antitumour activity in patients with melanoma and other cancers. Herein, we provide an overview of the complex process that is necessary to generate a personalized neoantigen vaccine, review the types of vaccine- induced T cells that are found within tumours and outline strategies to enhance the T cell responses. In addition, we discuss the current status of clinical studies testing personalized neoantigen vaccines in patients with cancer and considerations for future clinical investigation of this novel, individualized approach to immunotherapy.\\n\\n1Department of Medical Oncology, Dana- Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.\\n\\n2Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.\\n\\n3Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.\\n\\n4Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.\\n\\n✉e- mail: patrick_ott@ dfci.harvard.edu\\n\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/ s41571-020-00460-2\\n\\nVaccines have traditionally been used for the prevention of infectious diseases; however, the ability of such agents to elicit and amplify antigen- specific immune responses has long been recognized as a potentially valuable tool for the treatment of cancer. Early therapeutic vacci- nation strategies focused on self- antigens abnormally expressed or overexpressed in tumours, termed tumour- associated antigens (TAAs), were largely unsuccessful in generating clinically effective antitumour immune responses, probably owing to the TAA- specific T cells being subject to central and/or peripheral tolerance1. Such TAAs can also be expressed to some extent in nonmalignant tissues, which raises the risk of vaccine- induced autoimmune toxicities1. Thus, these early stud- ies highlighted the lack of tumour specificity and poor immuno genicity as fundamental issues to overcome in developing cancer vaccines.\\n\\nMutations occurring in tumour cells can gener- ate novel epitopes of self- antigens, which are referred to as neoepitopes or neoantigens. The advent of next- generation sequencing has provided opportunities to identify these tumour- specific mutations in individual patients in a timely and cost- effective manner and to explore therapies that target the mutated proteins in clin- ical studies. Additionally, the development of algorithms\\n\\nfor the prediction of MHC class I (MHC I)- binding epitopes has paved the way for the identification of potentially immunogenic neoepitopes. Together, these scientific advances have enabled the generation of per- sonalized therapeutic cancer vaccines that are tailored to the tumours of individual patients.'),\n",

First, neoantigens are exclusively expressed by tumour cells and can, therefore, elicit truly tumour- specific T cell responses, thereby preventing ‘off- target’ damage to nonmalignant tissues. Second, neoantigens are de novo epitopes derived from somatic mutations, which presents the possibility to circumvent T cell central tolerance of self- epitopes and thus induce immune responses to tumours. Personalized neoantigen- based vaccines there- fore afford the opportunity to boost tumour- specific immune responses and add an additional tool to the immunotherapy toolbox.

We also consider avenues for improvement and future investigation.\\n\\nNeoantigens and antitumour immunity Neoantigens are targets of effective tumour- specific immune responses. Neoantigens can arise through a vari- ety of mutational events, with the numbers and types of mutation varying by cancer type2,3. These events include point mutations, insertions or deletions (indels)4 and gene fusions5. In tumours driven by viruses, viral pro- teins can be considered an alternative class of neoanti- gen, owing to their foreign nature6. Tumours with a high mutational burden are likely to have several candidate neoantigens for vaccine formulation. Fewer neoantigens are likely to be present in tumours with a low mutational burden, which might restrict the number of immuno- genic epitopes7; however, the induction of neoantigen- specific immune responses using immunotherapy8 or therapeutic vaccination9,10 remains a possibility within this category of tumours.'),\n",

Accordingly, neoantigen presentation and load have been positively correlated with progno- sis in patients with a variety of cancers6,14,16,17 and with benefit from immune- checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with melanoma18,19, non- small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC)20,21 or colorectal cancer with mismatch- repair deficiency22. Together, these studies highlight the poten- tial therapeutic benefit of developing immunotherapies that specifically ‘train’ the immune system to target neoantigens.\\n\\nAs reviewed previously23–25, tumour mutational burden alone is an imperfect predictor of response to immunotherapy: additional factors determine whether a given mutation has the ability to induce an effective antitumour immune response, including the type of mutation (for example, clonal versus subclonal and single- nucleotide variant versus frameshift), to what extent the mutation is expressed, the ability of the encoded neoepitope to be presented by tumour cells and/or antigen- presenting cells (APCs), trafficking of T cells into the tumour and the immunosuppressive mechanisms active in the tumour or periphery of the host. Thus, even when targetable alterations are present, their existence alone might not be sufficient for effec- tive immunotherapy — other immunological param- eters are key determinants of efficacy. For example, in patients with prostate cancer, tumour mutational burden was not associated with response following treatment with the anti- CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab; however, a response to immunotherapy with this ICI was asso- ciated with a higher abundance of tumour- infiltrating CD8+ T cells and IFNγ- response gene signatures in pre- treatment tumours8. In addition, neoantigen- specific CD8+ T cells could be detected after therapy in blood from two of eight evaluated patients with favoura- ble responses to therapy, whereas neoantigen- specific responses were not observed in four evaluated patients with unfavourable responses8. Moreover, CD8+ T cell responses and myeloid signatures have been associated with progression- free survival (PFS) in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treated with the anti- PD- L1 antibody atezolizumab plus the anti- VEGFA antibody bevacizumab26. In patients with resectable pancre- atic cancer, neoantigen load alone was not correlated with overall survival (OS); however, correlations with OS were found when neoantigen load was combined with the abundance or diversity of tumour- infiltrating CD8+ T cells, or when neoantigen quality was consid- ered; these correlations were independent of adjuvant chemotherapy6. Whether a mutation is clonal or sub- clonal might also influence response to immunotherapy; in patients with microsatellite- stable solid tumours, clonal mutations were found to be associated with a response to ICI therapy, whereas a greater abundance of subclonal mutations was more likely to result in pro- gressive disease27. Furthermore, in this study, eight clonal neoantigens identified in driver genes (KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA) were associated with response across more than one patient27. Notably, tumour mutational bur- den might correlate with OS but not with response to anti- PD-1 antibodies28. Taken together, these findings indicate that, although neoantigens are promising tar- gets for immune- based therapies, consideration of addi- tional factors that can affect neoantigen- specific T cell responses and antitumour activity following therapeutic vaccination is crucial.\\n\\nNeoantigens and immunoediting.

Reduced expression of neoantigens has been detected in metastatic tumours arising in a patient with progression of pancreatic cancer following primary tumour resection6. Moreover, immunotherapy can shape the repertoire of neoanti- gens expressed by a variety of tumour types, including melanoma30, NSCLC31,32 and glioblastoma33, suggesting ongoing immunoediting.\\n\\nAlthough these algorithms enabled the development of the first neoantigen- based vaccines, they are contin- uously being optimized by incorporating endogenous peptide processing and presentation rules to enable more precise prediction of neoepitopes with the high- est likelihood of being presented on the cell surface via MHC I proteins. Epitope prediction based solely on binding affinity data inherently does not provide infor- mation about which endogenously processed peptides will be presented by MHC I proteins on the surface of tumour cells and/or APCs and will induce effective CD8+ T cell responses.\\n\\nNeoantigens and tumour heterogeneity. Tumours have a high degree of genetic heterogeneity, which has fun- damental implications for the efficacy of cancer ther- apy, including immunotherapy34. The ability to identify tumour- specific mutations in individual patients is a key component of directing T cell responses to elimi- nate tumours through vaccination, thus warranting a personalized approach for therapeutic vaccine design. Tumour heterogeneity can also result in variable expres- sion of neoantigens between or even within tumours present in an individual patient; therefore, elimination of tumour cells expressing a specific neoantigen can result in outgrowth of tumour cells not expressing that neoantigen34. Consequently, it will probably be necessary to target multiple neoantigens using a single vaccine to reduce the likelihood of immune evasion and effectively eradicate the disease in its entirety30.\\n\\nIdentifying immunogenic neoantigens Neoantigen prediction in silico. The computational algorithm- based pipelines for neoantigen discovery and prioritization used in studies of therapeutic cancer vaccines to date have had several general commonali- ties9,10,35–37. Details of these workflows have been exten- sively reviewed25,38–41. As such, we only briefly outline the neoantigen prediction process here, with a focus on advances made over the past few years.\\n\\nTo identify tumour- specific somatic mutations, tumour biopsy specimens and nonmalignant tissue samples (usually peripheral blood mononuclear cells) are acquired from the patient in order to perform whole- exome sequencing for the comparison of tumour and germline DNA. Additional RNA sequencing provides information on the expression of the mutated genes and further confirmation of the mutation calls. A high num- ber of tumour- specific mutations can often be identified, depending on the tumour type; however, not all muta- tions result in neoepitopes that are recognized by the immune system, owing to HLA restriction. More than 16,000 different alleles of the classical HLA class I genes (HLA- A, HLA- B and HLA- C) are known to exist;42 there- fore, HLA typing is required to enable the prediction of potentially immunogenic epitopes.\\n\\nMHC I- binding epitopes are predicted using com- putational approaches, and peptides with a predicted HLA- binding affinity in the moderate- to- strong range (IC50 < 150 nmol/l) are considered more likely to induce CD8+ T cell responses43. Various computational approaches for predicting MHC I- presented epitopes have been developed44, and historically these algorithms have been trained on peptide binding affinity data.'),\n",

In particular, algorithms trained using peptides presented by specific mono- allelic HLA- expressing cell lines better incorpo- rate endogenous antigen processing and presentation processes46,47. These MS- based algorithms can be further optimized by increasing the number of HLA alleles on which they are trained48. However, further studies are needed to improve understanding of the factors that can affect neo- antigen expression, presentation and immunogenicity. For example, data suggest that incorporating information on the position of a mutated residue within the peptide- binding groove could improve neoantigen discovery49.\\n\\nTo date, epitope- prediction methods have largely focused on MHC I- binding epitopes; MHC II- binding epitope prediction is much less advanced. The MHC I peptide- binding groove has closed ends that define the positioning of peptide epitopes 8–11 amino acids long for presentation to CD8+ T cells. By contrast, the MHC II peptide- binding groove has open ends, which confers the ability to bind and present peptides of longer and more variable lengths; the peptide regions flanking the portion bound to the core of the MHC II molecule can influence the binding of the peptide, and in addition these peptides can bind to multiple different MHC II molecules50. Together, these features of MHC II peptide binding complicate the identification of immunogenic MHC II epitopes. MHC II epitopes have, however, been incorporated indirectly into vaccine peptide design. Long peptides (15–30- mers) that encompass predicted MHC I- binding CD8+ T cell epitopes are used in vacci- nation strategies to promote uptake and processing of the peptides by professional APCs and thereby enhance T cell stimulation51,52. In addition to the presentation of predicted CD8+ T cell epitopes on MHC I proteins, this long- peptide approach is compatible with the pro- cessing and presentation of CD4+ T cell epitopes bound to MHC II proteins. Indeed, the preferential induction of CD4+ T cell responses compared with CD8+ T cell responses has been observed following vaccination in several clinical trials7,9,10,35,36,53. This observation might at least partially reflect the potential for pres- entation of a greater variety of peptides in the open- ended MHC II peptide- binding groove than in the more stringent MHC I peptide- binding groove54. Other immuno logical factors might also contribute to the dominance of vaccine- mediated CD4+ T cell response, such as differences in the stimulation of dendritic cell (DC) subsets that promote CD4+ T cell activation or,\\n\\nvolume 18 | April 2021 | 217\\n\\nvia cross- presentation of antigen, the induction of CD8+ T cell responses55.'),\n",

However, efforts have been made to develop better tools for the prediction of such epitopes, recognizing that CD4+ T cells can orchestrate antitumour immunity and, via their classical ‘helper’ functions, have a crucial role in generating and sustaining CD8+ T cell responses. A stride forward in HLA- II prediction was made in 2019 with the creation of a mono- allelic HLA expression sys- tem for profiling of the HLA ligandome, referred to as ‘mono- allelic purification with tagged allele constructs’ (MAPTAC)56. This system provided the ability to iden- tify peptide- binding motifs of individual HLA alleles via MS, including >40 HLA class II alleles, which in turn enabled the training of a new machine learning- based prediction algorithm, neonmhc2, to identify MHC II- presented epitopes56. In another study published in 2019 (REF.57), a similar MS- based approach combined with motif deconvolution and annotation was used to train a machine learning prediction algorithm, MixMHC2pred. Moreover, the MHC II- binding epitope- prediction algo- rithm NetMHCIIpan, which was initially developed using peptide binding affinity data from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), was updated in 2020 to include the NNAlign_MA algorithm trained using MS- derived data on peptides eluted from MHC II proteins58. These efforts underscore a current focus on enhancing the induction of tumour- specific CD4+ T cell responses to improve the effectiveness of therapeutic cancer vaccines. Although prediction algorithms are undergoing continual improvement, as stated earlier, additional factors can affect the ultimate immunogenicity of the predicted epitopes. These include the overall patterns of gene expression, RNA splicing, proteosomal pro- cessing and, crucially, peptide loading and presenta- tion by MHCs25,40. Additionally, neoantigen sequences with similarity to pathogen- derived epitopes can exhibit enhanced immunogenicity probably because they can be better distinguished from self- epitopes by T cells6. Obtaining a better understanding of these factors will be important in optimizing the immuno- genicity of neoantigen- based therapies, and incorpo- rating such variables into computational algorithms will enable the design of more effective therapeutic T cell vaccines.\\n\\nAdministration of tumour lysate- pulsed DCs to patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, either alone or in combination with bevacizumab with or with- out low- dose cyclophosphamide, was found to induce de novo neoantigen- specific CD8+ T cell responses and enhanced some neoantigen- specific responses that were detected prior to therapy60. Patients with ex vivo evidence of T cell responses to autologous tumour cells or DC- presented tumour antigens following therapy had improved PFS relative to those without such evidence of antitumour responses. Moreover, 2- year OS was 100% in those with antitumour T cell responses compared with 25% in non- responders. Addition of the vaccine to ther- apy also seemed to improve OS when compared with bevacizumab and low- dose cyclophosphamide combi- nation therapy (2- year OS 78% versus 44% in a matched historical control group; P = 0.046). Low- dose cyclophos- phamide significantly improved OS when given along- side bevacizumab and the vaccine (P = 0.012)60. These findings suggest that tumour- lysate- based vaccine ther- apies can induce antitumour T cell responses, includ- ing neoantigen- specific CD8+ T cell responses. Thus, the use of tumour- lysate- based approaches and/or antigen delivery via APCs merits further exploration. Additionally, tumour- lysate- based vaccines could poten- tially be used as priming vaccinations while a person- alized neoantigen- based vaccine is being designed and manufactured59.'),\n",

Following vaccination, assessment of T cell responses to epitopes included in the vaccines can be accomplished in vitro using a variety of tools. One approach to validating T cell specificity involves the trans- fection of genetic constructs encoding multiple patient- specific mutated epitopes, termed tandem minigenes, into APCs, followed by co- culture of the APCs with T cells isolated from the blood or tumour of the patient. Any APC subpopulations that induce T cell responses can then be further investigated to identify immunogenic epitopes61. Neoantigen- specific T cells have been detected using this technology in several different cancers61–64, including following therapeutic vaccination10,35, and this technology has also enabled the identification of neoantigen- specific T cell receptors (TCRs)62.\\n\\nAn alternative approach to inducing neoantigen- specific immune responses, beyond computational approaches, involves the use of tumour lysates59. Autol- ogous APCs, typically DCs, can be isolated from the patient and exposed to tumour lysates ex vivo, before being injected back into the patient with the aim of stimu- lating an immune response to TAAs or neoantigens. This method circumvents the sequencing and computational analysis required for the identification of patient- specific neoantigens59. As mentioned earlier, however, TAAs are less likely to be immunogenic and, in addition, might reduce the ability of relevant neoepitopes to stimulate immune responses owing to the higher abundance of nonimmunogenic self- antigens.\\n\\nNeoantigen vaccine- induced responses Immunogenicity and immunological profiling analyses conducted in clinical trials of personalized neoantigen- based vaccines have provided insight into the magni- tude, phenotype and functionality of vaccine- induced T cells (TablE 1). The first such trial used an autolo- gous DC- based vaccination strategy37, whereby three patients with stage III cutaneous melanoma previ- ously treated with ipilimumab were vaccinated with HLA- A*02:01- specific peptides encoding patient- specific tumour neoepitopes and three peptides from the melanoma- associated antigen gp100. Vaccination induced CD8+ T cell responses and a diverse TCR repertoire37; thus, this study was the first to reveal that therapeutic vaccination with neoantigens can increase both the diversity and breadth of T cell responses.\\n\\n218 | April 2021 | volume 18\\n\\nTable 1 | Key clinical trials of personalized neoantigen- based vaccines\\n\\nTrial\\n\\nPhase Tumour type\\n\\nVaccine format\\n\\nKey contributions\\n\\nRef.\\n\\nNCT00683670\\n\\nI\\n\\nAdvanced- stage melanoma\\n\\nDendritic cell Provided proof of concept that\\n\\nneoantigen vaccines can induce T cell responses\\n\\n37\\n\\nNeoVax (NCT01970358)\\n\\nI/Ib\\n\\nResected high- risk stage III/IV melanoma\\n\\nPeptide\\n\\nDemonstrated that neoantigen peptide- based vaccines can induce CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses and can be combined with ICIs\\n\\n35\\n\\nIVAC MUTANOME (NCT02035956)\\n\\nI\\n\\nNY- ESO-1- positive and/or tyrosinase- positive stage III or IV melanoma\\n\\nmRNA\\n\\nDemonstrated that mRNA vaccines incorporating TAAs and neoantigens can induce CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses and can be combined with ICIs\\n\\n36\\n\\nNeoVax (NCT02287428)\\n\\nI/Ib\\n\\nMGMT promoter- unmethylated glioblastoma\\n\\nPeptide\\n\\nDemonstrated that neoantigen vaccines can induce CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses in immunologically cold tumours with low mutational burdens\\n\\n10\\n\\nGAPVAC (NCT02149225)\\n\\nI\\n\\nGlioblastoma\\n\\nPeptide\\n\\nDemonstrated that peptide vaccines incorporating TAAs and neoantigens can induce CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses in immunologically cold tumours with low mutational burdens\\n\\n9\\n\\nICI, immune- checkpoint inhibitor; TAA, tumour- associated antigen.\\n\\nA subset of neoantigen- responsive T cells were detect- able prior to vaccination37, indicating that existing neoantigen- specific T cell responses were boosted, in addition to induction of de novo responses.'),\n",

The NeoVax vaccines comprised up to 20 different long peptides (15–30- mers), formulated with the adjuvant poly- ICLC (a TLR3 agonist consisting of carboxy- methylcellulose, polyinosinic–polycytidylic acid and poly- l- lysine double- stranded RNA). Previously unde- tectable neoantigen- specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were induced post- vaccination, with a greater fraction of the response consisting of CD4+ T cells35. These T cell popu- lations were polyfunctional, and neoantigen- specific CD4+ T cell transcriptional profiles post- vaccination revealed T helper 1 (TH1), effector and memory pro- grammes35. The four patients with stage III disease remained disease- free at a median follow- up duration of 25 months (range 20–32 months) after vaccination. The two patients with stage IV disease had disease recur- rence within a few months after the last vaccination and subsequently received pembrolizumab (an anti- PD-1 antibody), which resulted in complete regression of metastatic tumours in both patients and broadening of antitumour T cell responses35. This observation high- lights the potential of combination therapies to improve vaccine- induced T cell responses.\\n\\nIn a third phase I study36, a vaccine platform con- sisting of mRNAs encoding shared melanoma antigens (NY- ESO-1 and/or tyrosinase) and personalized neoan- tigen peptides was tested in 13 patients with stage III or IV melanoma. Profiling of T cells post- vaccination revealed that neoantigen- specific cytokine- producing CD8+ T cells\\n\\npresent in blood comprised central memory (TCM) and effector memory (TEM) populations36. Similar to the responses observed with NeoVax35, CD4+ T cell responses were greater in magnitude than CD8+ T cell responses36. Neoantigen- specific tumour- infiltrating lymphocytes were found in resected tumours from two patients. Together, these findings from studies in patients with melanoma provided proof of concept that personalized neoantigen- based vaccines can induce tumour- specific T cell responses in a therapeutic setting.\\n\\nMore recently, neoantigen- based vaccines have been studied in patients with glioblastoma, a cancer type that typically has a low mutational burden3,65 and that is generally considered to constitute an immuno- logically ‘cold’ tumour. In a phase I/Ib trial involving ten patients with MGMT promoter- unmethylated glio- blastoma, personalized long- peptide- based vaccines formulated with poly- ICLC (NeoVax) were admin- istered following standard- of- care surgical resection and radiotherapy10. Six of the eight vaccinated patients also received dexamethasone for the treatment of brain oedema, which impeded vaccine immunogenicity10. In the two vaccinated patients who did not receive dex- amethasone, however, neoantigen- specific CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses were detected in the periph- eral blood, and increased numbers of T cells were observed in intracranial tumours post- vaccination10. Transcriptomic analysis of tumour- associated T cells from one patient revealed varying degrees of expression of inhibitory receptors (including TIM3, LAG3, TIGIT and CTLA4), in addition to cytotoxicity signatures in both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells10. TCR reconstruc- tion revealed four neoantigen- specific CD4+ T cell and two neoantigen- specific CD8+ T cell clonotypes that were present in the post- treatment intracranial tumour. In the phase I GAPVAC-101 trial9, patients with glio- blastoma similarly received peptide- based vaccination\\n\\nvolume 18 | April 2021 | 219'),\n",

The vaccination regimen consisted of two parts, the first component (APVAC1) involving vaccination with up to seven MHC I- binding peptides and MHC II- binding peptides derived from unmutated glioblastoma- associated antigens, and the second com- ponent (APVAC2) involving patient- specific neoantigens (typically two)9. The unmutated glioblastoma- associated antigens included in APVAC1 induced CD8+ T cell responses across multiple cell subsets, including those with a central memory phenotype9. Neoantigens in APVAC2 induced predominantly CD4+ T cell res ponses that were multifunctional and TH1 polarized9. CD4+ T cells specific for glioblastoma- associated anti- gen incorporated in the APVAC1 vaccine were found in resected tumour tissue obtained after recurrence from one patient, which suggests that vaccine- induced T cells have the ability to traffic into tumour tissue.\\n\\nNo clear signals of clinical benefit that could be attrib- uted to the vaccines were seen in either of the studies involving patients with glioblastoma. Nevertheless, evidence from both studies provides proof of con- cept that neoantigen- based vaccines can generate tumour- infiltrating T cell responses in immuno logically cold tumours with a low mutational burden, which supports further investigations aiming to optimize neoantigen- based therapeutic vaccines for such tumours. Altogether, these initial studies provided impor- tant knowledge of the immunogenicity and therapeu- tic potential of neoantigen- based personalized cancer vaccines. However, the extent of the induction and persistence of long- lived neoantigen- specific memory T cells in long- term survivors remains to be determined. Deeper phenotypic and functional analysis of these memory T cell populations could provide insights into the importance of subsets of memory T cells induced post- vaccination, particularly their potential to eliminate residual tumour cells.\\n\\nOptimally inducing antitumour responses Vaccine- induced immune responses have been exten- sively studied in the context of preventive vaccines for infectious disease, in order to understand the immuno- logical mechanisms of vaccination and their implica- tions for vaccine- mediated protection against infectious organisms. In the context of cancer, the stimulation of tumour- specific immune responses faces unique challenges that can limit the efficacy of therapeutic vaccines.\\n\\nVaccine development and optimization strategies typically involve testing the suitability of different delivery platforms, adjuvants, routes of administration, prime–boost strategies and incorporated antigens, all of which can affect the nature of the induced immune responses (as previously reviewed38). A key factor in the choice of a therapeutic cancer vaccine platform relates to how rapidly the vaccine can be designed, manufactured, administered and elicit antitumour T cell responses. Candidate vaccine platforms include peptides66, RNA67, DNA68, DCs69 and viral vectors70. Indeed, multiple\\n\\nplatforms hold promise for use in the development of personalized cancer vaccines and can be built upon for improvements.\\n\\nPriming of T cell responses. The immunological cascade elicited following vaccination commences rapidly with the induction of innate immune responses and uptake of antigens by APCs, which leads to priming of T cell responses in the draining lymph nodes56. Antigen- specific T cell responses then undergo an expansion phase, followed after antigen clearance by a contrac- tion phase that culminates in the generation of small populations of long- lived memory T cells71 (Fig. 1).'),\n",

This con- sideration is relevant because boosting immunizations will probably be needed to ensure adequate induction of neoantigen- specific T cell responses. Indeed, repet- itive antigen stimulation has the potential to continu- ally affect the gene- expression and functional profiles of memory CD8+ T cells72–74. Similar to preventive vaccines75, the timing of the administration of priming and boosting immunizations with therapeutic vaccines should be considered carefully, as should the timing of any combination therapies, given that these factors can all affect the resulting T cell phenotypes. Additionally, different adjunctive treatments might be needed for var- ious tumour types to account for their distinct immune microenvironments.\\n\\nThe quality and magnitude of CD8+ T cell responses can be influenced by numerous factors71,76,77, resulting in variable memory T cell populations with dis tinct anatomical distributions and functional capabili- ties78. In the context of cancer, induction of effective neoantigen- specific T cell responses can be compro- mised by peripheral tolerance mechanisms, a result of either regulatory T (Treg) cell- mediated suppression79 or tolerogenic T cell priming by DCs80. Theoretically, memory T cells induced through therapeutic vaccina- tion should persist in the long term following tumour clearance and might, therefore, contribute to protec- tion against future tumour recurrence (Fig. 1). Thus, the memory T cell populations that develop after therapeu- tic vaccination need to be investigated in preclinical models and, ideally, in patients with cancer78,81.\\n\\nMultiple memory T cell subsets exist, including TCM, TEM, resident memory T (TRM) and peripheral memory T (TPM) populations. TCM cells are most associated with local- ization to secondary lymphoid tissues, albeit with some degree of circulation in the blood81. TCM cells have a vast proliferative capacity, which enables them to mount vig- orous recall responses77. TEM cells mostly circulate in the blood and periphery, and can, therefore, rapidly respond to antigenic challenges82. TEM cells have a greater capacity for cytotoxicity and cytokine production than TCM cells, but have a lesser proliferative capacity than other memory T cell populations77.\\n\\nTRM cells localize within tissues to provide rapid responses upon antigen detection, including the release of cytokines and activation of other immune cell\\n\\n220 | April 2021 | volume 18\\n\\nBoosting of existing T cell responses\\n\\nPeak\\n\\nPatrol for recurrence?\\n\\nTCM cells\\n\\nd e c u d n i - e n i c c a V\\n\\ne s n o p s e r\\n\\nl l\\n\\ne c T\\n\\nInduced responses via epitope spreading\\n\\nDe novo induction\\n\\nContraction\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nTEM cells\\n\\nTRM cells\\n\\nr u o m u T\\n\\nn e d r u b\\n\\nTime post-vaccination\\n\\nTPM cells\\n\\nFig. 1 | Personalized neoantigen-based vaccination has the potential to induce long-lasting tumour-specific memory T cell populations.

These T cells proliferate and kill tumour cells expressing the neoantigen. As tumour cells are eliminated, the release of tumour antigens might contribute to epitope spreading and thus an increased breadth of the tumour- specific T cell response. Following tumour eradication, the responding T cell populations contract, although subpopulations persist as components of the memory T cell pool. Indeed, vaccine- induced neoantigen- specific T cells have the potential to generate long- lived central memory T (TCM) cells and effector memory T (TEM) cells. Whether neoantigen- based vaccination can generate tissue- resident memory T (TRM) cells or peripheral memory T (TPM) cells remains unknown.'),\n",

High numbers of intratumoural TRM cells are correlated with favourable OS in patients with lung cancer89,90 or head and neck cancer91. Moreover, a high abundance of tumour- resident TRM cells expressing TIM3 and PD-1 has been associated with a response to anti- PD-1 therapy in patients with lung cancer92. In a mouse model of head and neck cancer, TRM cells induced by preventive vaccination with a DC- targeted human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16)- derived E7 peptide con- tributed to tumour control, together with other mem- ory T cell populations89. TRM cells patrol a wide variety of organs85,93; therefore, inducing neoantigen- specific TRM cells through therapeutic vaccination might provide long- term immunosurveillance and protection against disease recurrence94.\\n\\nTPM cells are a more- recently described subset of CD8+ T cells and have been observed to participate in immunosurveillance of peripheral tissues in viral infec- tion models82. TPM cells can traffic through peripheral tissues, have self- renewal capacity and can differentiate into the highly proliferative TCM cells82, which underscores the potential benefits of harnessing this cell population in vaccination strategies. Although a better under- standing of this novel T cell subset is needed, the immuno surveillance function of TPM cells might prove particularly useful in preventing metastatic tumour recurrences.\\n\\npatients with cancer to date induce both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells expressing several inhibitory recep- tors9,10,35,36, suggesting that functional blockade of these receptors will be necessary to produce effective neoantigen- specific T cell responses. This hypothesis is supported by data from the trial of the melanoma vaccine NeoVax, in which two patients who had recur- rent tumours had complete tumour regression follow- ing treatment with pembrolizumab35. Findings from a number of studies demonstrate that TCF1- expressing ‘progenitor exhausted’ CD8+ T cells are capable of self- renewal or differentiation into terminally exhausted effector T cells and are important for the efficacy of ICIs103–106 and therapeutic vaccines106.\\n\\nThe importance of CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells have crucial roles in supporting the development of CD8+ T cell responses through licensing of DCs that prime CD8+ T cells, in addition to the provision of cytokines such as IL-2 (REF.107) This ‘help’ provided by CD4+ T cells is important for devel- oping antitumour CD8+ T cell responses108–112, including in the context of immune- checkpoint inhibition111. CD4+ T cells also produce cytokines that mediate the recruit- ment and activa tion of immune cell populations109,111,113–116 (Fig. 2). Furthermore, IFNγ produced by CD4+ T cells can indirectly result in the elimination of tumour cells117. Alter- natively, immunosuppressive CD4+ Treg cells can dampen immune responses and are often found within the tumour microenvironment (TME)79.\\n\\nCircumventing CD8+ T cell exhaustion. T cell exhaus- tion is one of the major challenges in antitumour immunity95. CD8+ T cell exhaustion is a gradual pro- cess96,97, which eventually leads to an irreversible dys- functional programme owing to epigenetic changes98–102.

Given the variety of crucial immunological roles of CD4+ T cells and their potential to shape vaccine- elicited immune responses, understanding the antitumour functions of this cell population (Fig. 2) and how they could be harnessed for neoantigen vaccines will be important122,123.\\n\\nAn early example suggesting a potential role of CD4+ T cells in therapeutic vaccination is provided by a study of a DC- based vaccine involving patients with stage III or IV melanoma, wherein inclusion of MHC II epitopes for TAAs in the vaccine resulted in increased induction of both TAA- specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells (in skin and/or blood) in some patients124. In mouse models of therapeutic cancer vaccines, the induction of tumour- specifc CD4+ T cells resulted in CD8+ T cells with improved effector functions111,125, a memory phenotype111, reduced expression of inhibitory markers (such as PD-1) and enhanced migration to and infiltra- tion of tumours, resulting in improved tumour control125. Indeed, the inclusion of MHC II neoantigens in vaccines contributed substantially to tumour eradication in multi- ple mouse models, with evidence of TME reshaping and CD8+ T cell epitope spreading observed53. These findings indicate the importance of eliciting CD4+ T cell responses using therapeutic vaccination to optimize CD8+ T cell responses and tumour control.\\n\\nIn addition to supporting CD8+ T cell responses, data from a mouse model of sarcoma have shown that expression of antigen that is MHC II restricted by\\n\\nElimination of MHC II+ tumours?\\n\\nGranzyme A\\n\\nCytotoxic gene expression signature\\n\\nGranzyme K\\n\\n‘Help’\\n\\nCD4+ T cell\\n\\nImmune cell recruitment\\n\\nTNF\\n\\nIFNγ\\n\\ntumours has been shown to be crucial for the efficacy of ICI therapy or a tumour vaccine even when the tumour cells themselves do not express MHC II111. This study similarly revealed that expression of an MHC II epitope and CD4+ T cell help was important for the induction of CD8+ T cell responses, and expression of an MHC II epitope by the tumour resulted in increased frequency of both intratumoural CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells111. Moreover, expression of MHC II antigens was asso- ciated with greater accumulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)- positive macrophages111. Thus, CD4+ T cell assistance in recruiting innate immune cells might have a role in vaccine efficacy. A potential role of recruited innate immunity is supported by findings of cell- depletion studies in a mouse model of therapeutic vaccination in combination with recombinant IL-2, an anti- PD-1 antibody and a TAA- targeting antibody126. Thus, the effects of vaccine- induced neoantigen- specific T cells on the landscape of innate immune cell popu- lations in tumours should be investigated in patients with cancer.'),\n",

Single- cell tran- scriptomic analyses of CD4+ T cells in a mouse model of colon adenocarcinoma and in human liver cancers demonstrated heterogeneity among the CD4+ T cells infiltrating tumours and tumour- draining lymph nodes, and a particular subset had a defined gene signature that was enriched in patients with intrinsic resistance to ICIs128. Furthermore, transcriptional profiling of neoantigen- vaccine- induced CD4+ T cells in patients with glioblastoma revealed cytotoxic signatures10. Most tumours are MHC II negative, although emerging evi- dence indicates that some tumours express MHC II129. Moreover, IFNγ produced by tumour- specific CD4+ T cells can stimulate upregulation of tumoural expres- sion of MHC II, which resulted in direct CD4+ T cell- mediated tumour elimination in a mouse model of melanoma130. Tumour- infiltrating cytotoxic CD4+ T cells have also been found in human bladder cancers and to have MHC II- dependent cytotoxic activity against the autologous tumour cells131. Whether cytotoxic CD4+ T cells induced by a therapeutic vaccine could mediate antitumour activity directly remains unclear and should be further investigated. This question is particularly important given that the neoantigen- based vaccines evaluated in the initial clinical studies induced a greater degree of CD4+ T cell response than CD8+ T cell response.\\n\\n↑ Antigen\\n\\ncross-presentation\\n\\nCytokine production\\n\\nFig. 2 | Roles of neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells following therapeutic vaccination. CD4+ T cells have many roles in the vaccine- induced antitumour immune response. By interacting with dendritic cells and enhancing antigen cross- presentation, CD4+ T cells perform the well- described roles of providing ‘help’ in the generation of the antitumour cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses. CD4+ T cells can also produce many cytokines, including IFNγ and TNF, that stimulate and modulate immune responses. In addition, other types of immune cell with potential antitumour activity, such as macrophages, can be recruited as a result of CD4+ T cell- related responses. Interestingly, cytotoxic gene- expression signatures have been observed in neoantigen- specific CD4+ T cells induced following therapeutic vaccination, which indicates that these cells might contribute to the elimination of tumours with upregulation of MHC class II (MHC II) proteins (dashed arrow); however, whether vaccine- induced neoantigen- specific CD4+ T cells do indeed have this capacity needs to be investigated further.\\n\\nAlthough antitumour CD4+ T cell responses have clearly been demonstrated, emerging evidence indi- cates that neoantigen- specific CD4+ Treg cells also exist. Tumour antigen- specific Treg cells have been observed in both peripheral blood and tumour specimens from patients with metastatic melanoma or gastrointes- tinal or ovarian cancers; the expansion of these spe- cific Treg cell clonotypes probably occurs in the TME, in a neoantigen- selective manner132. Neoantigen- specific Treg cells might have important implications for therapeutic vaccines.

The manufacturing time is dependent on the choice of vaccine platform, as indicated for the various platforms listed along the red arrow. However, while the personalized vaccine is being designed and manufactured, combinatorial therapies can be administered to the patient with the aim of fostering a favourable immunological milieu. Adjunctive therapies can also be given either at the time of or following vaccination to enhance the immune response. Additional variables include the route of administration of the vaccine and any combination therapies, as well as the number of booster vaccinations. In the case of disease recurrence, tumour DNA sequencing can be repeated (for example, to understand why the vaccine was ineffective for long- term tumour control and/or to identify potential alternative neoantigens), and vaccine- induced T cell responses can be evaluated using both blood and tumour s a m p l es t o i nf orm d ec is ions r eg ar ding s ub se qu ent t he ra py.

The exact mechanism of these inhibitory neoantigens has not been defined; however, using the ATLAS platform, immunostimulatory and inhibitory epitopes can be identified through high- throughput ex vivo screening assays involving autologous T cells and APCs134. Together, these observations highlight the need to obtain a better understanding of the CD4+ T cell phenotypes induced by therapeutic vaccination.\\n\\nDesigning effective vaccine- induced immune responses.

Methodical testing of vaccination regimens will provide insights into how various vaccine strategies influence the magnitude and phenotype of neoantigen- specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Thus, detailed immuno phenotyping should be conducted to clearly define T cell phenotypes and responses.

Given that ICIs targeting PD-1 or PD- L1 have broad clinical efficacy across cancers and that antitumour activity seems to depend on the presence of pre- existing T cell responses in the tumour (that is, an immunologically ‘hot’ TME), testing personalized vaccines in combination with PD-1 or PD- L1 inhibition is a logical next step in the clinical development of these therapies (Fig. 3). The observation of complete responses to PD-1 inhibitors in patients with melanoma who had dis- ease progression during or after therapeutic neoantigen- based vaccination35 has been interpreted as potentially indicative of synergy between ICIs and vaccination, although complete responses can sporadically occur with PD-1 inhibition alone in patients with metastatic mela- noma. In line with these considerations, ongoing clini- cal trials are combining personalized neoantigen- based vaccines with PD-1, PD- L1 and/or CTLA4 inhibitors in various tumour types (TablE 2).\\n\\nA personalized long- peptide vaccine formulated with poly- ICLC (NEO- PV-01) has been assessed in combination with nivolumab in the phase Ib NT-001 trial involving patients with advanced- stage mela- noma (n = 34), NSCLC (n = 27) or urothelial carcinoma (n = 21)135.

Vaccine- specific TCRs were detected in post- vaccination tumour samples from two patients with melanoma, one of whom had a radiographic response, and one who had stable disease following treatment135, indicating that the vaccines induced traf- ficking of neoantigen- specific T cells into metastatic tumours. Clinical benefit obser ved after vaccination could not be directly attributed to the vaccine owing to the use of nivolumab and the nonrandomized design of the study, although longitudinal assessments of biopsy samples revealed that major pathological responses occurred after vaccination in nine patients with melanoma who did not have such a response to initial pre- vaccination treatment with nivolumab, three of whom had a residual tumour burden of >80% prior to vaccination135. Moreover, evidence of epitope spreading of the T cell responses to neoantigens not contained in the vaccines (suggesting vaccine- mediated tumour cell killing) was observed. Notably, epitope spread- ing was associated with a lack of disease progression at 6 months after initiation of therapy in the urothe- lial carcinoma group and at 9 months in the NSCLC and melanoma groups (P = 0.03 across groups), trans- lating into improved PFS in the three groups overall (HR 0.23, 95% CI 0.06–0.83; P = 0.01)135.

Preliminary signals of clinical activity have been obtained using personalized neoantigen- based vaccines in several proof- of- concept studies (conducted primar- ily in patients with resected melanoma who were at high risk of disease recurrence)35,36. However, initial clinical trials in patients with advanced- stage solid tumours treated with personalized vaccines in combination with ICI have not demonstrated ORRs that are clearly supe- rior to those achieved with ICI monotherapy135,137,138. In the NT-001 study135, the number of patients who con- verted from initial disease progression during the ICI monotherapy period to a response after vaccination with NEO- PV-01 was modest (13%). The possibility that combination therapy with personalized vaccines and ICI could prolong anti- PD-1- mediated responses remains; however, the personalized neoantigen vaccines used in the studies to date have been mostly ineffective in addressing the issue of primary resistance to PD-1 ICIs, at least when given after the initiation of and/or concurrently with PD-1 inhibition.

Despite the apparently modest levels of clinical benefit shown to date, correlative analyses of data from the initial trials of neoantigen- based vaccines provided evidence of robust immunogenicity and on- target tumour cell killing. Neoepitope- specific responses of both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were seen in all vacci- nated patients in the phase Ib studies of peptide plus poly- ICLC vaccine NEO- PV-01 and the RNA–lipoplex vaccine RO7198457 (REFS135,137). Furthermore, traffick- ing of vaccine- induced neoantigen- specific T cells to metastatic tumours was observed in both studies135,137. In the trial of NEO- PV-01, epitope spreading and post-vaccination pathological responses correlated with prolonged PFS135. Nevertheless, T cell responses were not consistently detected in ex vivo assays, and a relatively large proportion of the vaccine neoepitopes did not stimulate T cell responses135,137. Furthermore, although large numbers of T cells targeting certain neoepitopes were detected, many vaccine neoepitopes induced only low- frequency responses135,137. As we have described, one challenge in the field of cancer vaccine research relates to improving our under standing of how to induce maximum activation and expansion of T cell responses and of CD8+ T cells in particular. To accomplish this aim, complementary therapies that promote APC function and optimal priming of T cells in the lymph nodes will probably be necessary (Fig. 3). Therapeutic agents with the potential to achieve this include ICIs, agonists of co- stimulatory receptors (such as CD40), TLR agonists and growth factors supporting DC development and/or function (such as granulocyte– macrophage colony- stimulating factor (GM- CSF) and Fms- related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L). We are conducting phase I trials in patients with completely resected advanced-stage RCC (NCT02950766) or unresectable melanoma (NCT03929029), in which personalized neoantigen- based vaccines are being coadministered with ipilimumab, an ICI targeting CTLA4 (TablE 2). In preclinical models of lymphoma, in situ vaccination approaches consisting of intu- moural injections of FLT3L and poly-ICLC plus local radiotherapy led to the recruitment of cross-priming DCs and improved the efficacy of PD-1 inhibition139. The in situ vaccination strategy alone induced objec- tive responses, including some abscopal responses, in patients with treatment- resistant non- Hodgkin lymphomas; furthermore, non- responders had incre ases in the abundance of phenotypically exhausted, PD-1+CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood following treat- ment, supporting the combination of this approach with PD-1 inhibition139.\\n\\nAnother challenge relates to the identification of a vaccine delivery system that enables rapid, cost- effective manufacturing and thus timely deployment of the vaccines (Fig. 3). As reviewed previously140, different vaccine formats — comprising peptides, RNA, DNA, viral constructs or DCs — each have advantages and disadvantages; however, head- to- head comparisons of\\n\\n226 | April 2021 | volume 18\\n\\nTumour biopsy\\n\\nNon-malignant tissue (peripheral blood)\\n\\ns C F S f o r e b m u N\\n\\nELISpot\\n\\nWeeks after vaccination\\n\\nSomatic mutation identiﬁcation and HLA typing\\n\\nIdentiﬁcation of immunogenic epitopes\\n\\n+\\n\\nConﬁrm expression of mutated genes\\n\\nWild type\\n\\nMutated epitope\\n\\nControl\\n\\nT cells\\n\\nscRNA-seq\\n\\nPopulation 1 Population 2 Population 3 Population 4 Population 5\\n\\nTarget discovery\\n\\nVaccine formulation and administration\\n\\nImmune assessment\\n\\nAreas for advancement\\n\\nNon-SNV mutation calling pipelines\\n\\nIn silico MHC II epitope prediction algorithms incorporating MS\\n\\nNeoepitope validation\\n\\nVaccine platforms (peptide, RNA, dendritic cell, DNA or viral vectors)\\n\\nInclusion of predicted MHC II epitopes\\n\\nSequencing and dosing schedules'),\n",

Many areas of advancement might improve the efficacy of personalized vaccines, as indicated in this figure. For example, the identification of targetable neoantigens could be improved through development of better prediction algorithms. Various vaccine modalities and dosing schedules could be explored to generate maximally effective antitumour immune responses. Importantly, detailed assessments of the characteristics of the immune responses induced by vaccination could be used to inform iterative improvements in the approach to vaccine design and administration. These include evaluating the magnitude of neoantigen- specific responses (by ELISpot) and in- depth phenotyping via single- cell RNA sequencing (scRNA- seq) analyses.

This situation most probably reflects the current reality of the clinical drug development landscape, in which vaccine formats are typically chosen based on the available tech- nology, in- house experience and intellectual property, among other criteria. Conceivably, cooperative groups could perform such comparative studies, although sys- tematic comparisons of different personalized vaccine platforms are unlikely to be undertaken in the near term given the current high costs and complexity of this therapeutic approach.\\n\\nThe timing of ICI administration and therapeu- tic vaccination is another important consideration (Fig. 3). This point was highlighted in a preclinical study in which concurrent administration of a PD-1 inhibitor and a therapeutic cancer vaccine improved both vaccine- induced immune responses and tumour control in a mouse model141. Conversely, PD-1 inhi- bition before vaccination resulted in a population of PD-1+CD38hiCD8+ T cells that were dysfunctional in the same model, a finding that was attributed to a sub- optimal priming environment for induction of CD8+ T cell responses141. Indeed, this PD-1+CD38hiCD8+ T cell population was shown to contribute to immunotherapy failure in mice, and patients with intrinsic resistance to PD-1 ICIs were found to have higher numbers of these dysfunctional T cells in blood and tumour samples than responders141. Thus, combining ICIs with therapeutic vaccination regimens can be beneficial, but will require\\n\\ncareful consideration of the most appropriate sequencing of the component therapies.'),\n",

Initial studies have shown that personalized neoantigen- based vaccines can be generated and administered safely to individual patients with cancer. In- depth profiling of vaccine- induced T cell responses, includ- ing the use of newly available immunogenomic tools, has demonstrated that all vaccinated patients develop T cell responses to subsets of the immunizing epitopes and that vaccine- induced T cells can traffic into meta- static tumours. Neoantigen- prediction algorithms have largely focused on MHC I epitopes, but a predominance of CD4+ T cell responses has been observed. Despite emerging evidence of crucial roles of CD4+ T cells, developing strategies that induce maximal cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses remains important, in addition to the robust neoantigen- specific CD4+ T cell responses elicited in the initial trials to date (Fig. 4). Numerous studies utilizing a spectrum of different vaccine delivery platforms and combination therapies are underway, with the ultimate goal of stimulating effective, long- lasting, tumour- specific immunity in patients with cancer.\\n\\nPublished online 20 January 2021\\n\\nvolume 18 | April 2021 | 227\\n\\n1.

              "\"An antigen is a substance that can trigger an immune response in the body by stimulating the production of antibodies or activating immune cells like T cells. Antigens can be foreign substances from pathogens (viruses, bacteria, etc.) or can originate from the body's own cells (self-antigens).\\n\\nIn the context of cancer immunology, there are two main types of antigens discussed:\\n\\n1. Tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) - These are self-antigens that are overexpressed in tumor cells compared to normal cells. Examples include cancer-testis antigens like MAGE that are normally only expressed in germ cells but get aberrantly expressed in some cancers.\\n\\n2. Tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) or neoantigens - These arise from mutations in the tumor cells that create novel protein sequences not present in normal cells. The mutant peptides can be presented by MHC molecules and recognized as foreign by T cells.\\n\\nHarnessing the immune system to recognize tumor antigens, especially the patient-specific neoantigens, is a key strategy behind cancer vaccines and immunotherapies. The antigens serve as targets that allow the activated T cells to selectively recognize and destroy the tumor cells expressing those antigens.\""
